Most organizations are built like machines.

We design them for efficiency, control, predictability. Clear hierarchies. Defined roles. Processes that repeat.

But living systems work differently.

They adapt. They respond to context. They grow through relationships, not org charts. They're resilient because diversity is built in, not bolted on.

The problem? Our tools and structures haven't caught up.

We're trying to run organizations that need to be alive using frameworks designed for factories. No wonder so many feel broken.

I've been thinking about this for years. Through philosophy, through building Offcourse, through watching communities thrive and collapse. The pattern keeps repeating: the best organizations don't fight their nature as living systems. They lean into it.

That's what ecosystem architecture is about.

Not replacing hierarchy with chaos. Not abandoning structure. But designing organizations the way you'd design a forest, not a factory. Where emergence is expected. Where diversity is strength. Where the system can learn and adapt.

I've written about some of these ideas over the years:

What does your organization feel like right now: machine or living system?
