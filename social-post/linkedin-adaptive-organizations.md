We've been building organizations like machines for 200 years.

Hierarchies. Standardized processes. Command and control.

It worked when the world changed slowly. When knowledge was scarce. When you could predict what came next.

But we don't live in that world anymore.

The organizations thriving right now aren't the most optimized—they're the most adaptive. They treat people like participants in a living system, not cogs in a machine.

This isn't about being nice. It's about survival.

I've spent years exploring what this actually means in practice—from Offcourse to bootcamps to building Rizom. Each project taught me something about how communities actually thrive.

I've written about some of these lessons:

The question isn't whether we can build differently. We're already doing it, whether we admit it or not.

The real question: Are you designing for it intentionally, or just reacting to the chaos?
