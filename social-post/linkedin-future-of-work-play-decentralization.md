title: Future of Work Play Decentralization

We've been telling people to find work that matters.

But we haven't changed the structures that make meaningful work nearly impossible.

Remote work solved geography. Distributed teams solved coordination. But they didn't solve the real problem: we're still trying to run living systems like machines.

Decentralized organizations aren't just about spreading people across locations. They're about fundamentally rethinking how knowledge flows, how decisions get made, and how communities actually thrive.

The tension is real though:
- More autonomy can mean less coherence
- Distributed decision-making takes longer
- You lose the watercooler moments (though those were often just surveillance in disguise)

But here's what I've learned building ecosystem architecture: the future isn't about choosing between hierarchy and chaos. It's about structures that breathe. Systems that adapt. Organizations that work more like living networks than org charts.

The question isn't whether decentralization is coming. It's whether we'll design it intentionally or let it happen to us.

What does meaningful work actually look like in a decentralized context? I explore this further here:
