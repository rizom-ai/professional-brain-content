  We tell our children to find work that matters. To be creative. To follow
  their passion.


  Then we spend our days in meetings about meetings.


  There's a quiet crisis happening: we're wasting human talent on work that
  doesn't matter, defending positions we don't believe in, waiting for
  permission to do what could start today.


  The real issue isn't burnout. It's that we're using industrial-era frameworks
  to organize post-industrial lives.


  The most meaningful human activities have always felt more like play than
  work. When we create value naturally, we don't mind the overtime. When work is
  voluntary, creative, and aligned with who we actually are—that's when
  remarkable things happen.


  For the first time, we can build this way. AI handles the busywork. Remote
  tools dissolve geographic constraints. Creator platforms enable direct value
  exchange without institutional middlemen. Blockchain creates trust without
  gatekeepers.


  The infrastructure exists. The tools are here. The only question is whether
  you'll help shape this future or wait for others to build it.


  I've written more on this:

  What does work feel like to you right now—obligation or play?
