Most of what we call "decentralization" is actually just a rebranding of power dynamics that already existed centuries ago.

The real innovation isn't blockchain. It's happening in Shenzhen.

The shanzhai—China's informal hardware ecosystem—have cracked something the West is still struggling with: how to build at scale without centralized control. They do it through gongkai—literally "open sharing"—where manufacturers freely distribute blueprints, bills of materials, and designs.

This isn't open source. It's something better suited for hardware.

While the West treats IP as broadcast (credit the inventor, extract royalties), China's network view treats it as favors. You stand on others' shoulders to see further. You trade ideas. You iterate faster.

The result? Civil resilience. Economic diversity. Products that adapt to actual market needs in weeks, not quarters.

But there's a shadow side we can't ignore.

Speed breeds waste. The accelerated iteration cycle that drives innovation also drives mountains of e-waste. Rapid prototyping, cheaper materials, coal-powered factories. The environmental cost is brutal.

The question isn't whether gongkai works—it clearly does. The question is whether we can build it regeneratively.

Can we keep the agility and decentralization while actually accounting for what gets left behind?
