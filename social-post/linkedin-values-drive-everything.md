We spend more time at work than anywhere else.

Yet most organizations still treat values as a checkbox—something to post on the wall, not something that shapes how decisions get made.

The problem isn't that we lack values. It's that we've separated them from our actual practice.

When your values don't align with your work, something breaks. You either compromise your integrity or burn out trying to hold the line. Neither is sustainable.

I've been thinking about this for years—how do we build organizations where values aren't decorative, but structural? Where they inform how we code, how we hire, how we treat each other?

It starts with naming them clearly. Not corporate platitudes, but the actual principles that guide your choices.

Then comes the harder part: designing systems and practices that reinforce those values every single day.

This is what I explore in my essay on Value Driven Development—how to make your values operational, not aspirational.

What values actually shape your work? And more importantly—do your daily practices reflect them?
