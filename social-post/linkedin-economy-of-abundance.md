We've built our entire economic system on scarcity.

But what if that's the wrong lens?

I've been thinking about Bataille's economy of excess—the idea that abundance, not scarcity, is the fundamental condition we need to design for. It reframes everything: how we build organizations, how we value work, how we measure success.

The problem is we're still using scarcity-based tools to solve abundance-based problems.

We optimize for efficiency when we should be designing for flourishing. We treat knowledge like a finite resource when it actually multiplies when shared. We measure value in extraction instead of circulation.

This isn't just philosophy—it changes how you architect ecosystems, how you build teams, how you think about what matters.

I explored this deeper in a recent essay on the economy of garbage and abundance thinking.

What economic assumption are you still operating from that might actually be holding you back?
