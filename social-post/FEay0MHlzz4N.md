  Ecosystems don't need to be confined to one place anymore.


  That's the insight that changes everything about how we design organizations.


  For decades, we borrowed the term "ecosystem" from biology—bound to geography,
  bound to time. But digital networks broke that rule. Now you can build
  thriving communities across continents, asynchronously, without hierarchies.


  The problem? Our management frameworks haven't caught up.


  We're still trying to run distributed organizations with industrial-era tools.
  Treating them like machines instead of living systems. And it shows—burnout,
  fragmentation, people searching for meaning in work that feels hollow.


  This is why I've been thinking about ecosystem architecture: the practice of
  designing and cultivating organizations as living systems, not machines. It
  borrows from everywhere—philosophy, Afrofuturism, permaculture, Shanzhai
  culture, DAOs. Not because it's trendy, but because thriving ecosystems
  require that kind of intellectual diversity.


  I just published the first piece in a series exploring this:

  It traces how we got here, why the old metaphors broke down, and what it
  actually means to design for organizations that work *with* human nature
  instead of against it.


  What's your experience—have you felt the gap between how organizations are
  managed and how they actually need to function?
