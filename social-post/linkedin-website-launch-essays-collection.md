After years of scattered thinking across platforms, I've finally consolidated my work in one place.

My new website brings together essays written over the past decade—from philosophy of technology to ecosystem architecture to the future of work.

Some of these pieces are old (2013 thinking on tools and their limits). Some are recent (why the future of work might actually be play). All of them ask the same underlying question: what kind of structures and tools do we need to build?

The essays explore:
- How our tools shape what we can think
- Why development practices need to be grounded in values, not just behavior
- What "false media" really means in an age of algorithmic distribution
- How innovation happens at the level of practice, not just products

I've spent years building—Offcourse, bootcamps, now Rizom. Each project taught me something that found its way into these essays.

If you're interested in ecosystem design, decentralized organizations, or just thinking about what comes next, there's something here for you.
