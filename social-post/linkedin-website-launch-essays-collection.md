After years of scattered thinking across platforms, I've finally brought it all together in one place.

My new website collects essays written over the past decade: from philosophy of technology to ecosystem architecture to the future of work.

Some of these pieces are old. (2013 me, wrestling with tools and their limits.) Some are recent. (Why the future of work might actually be play.) All of them circle the same question:

**What kind of structures and tools do we actually need to build?**

The threads running through them:

- Why we need new institutions built on social contracts, not constitutions
- What we lose when AI follows a single evolutionary path, and what the forgotten futures still have to teach us
- How ecosystem architecture is a practice for designing inhabitable futures against predetermined ones
- Why the future of work is play. Not because it's easy, but because it should be voluntary, creative, and aligned

I have spent years building things: Offcourse, Superconnectors, now Rizom. Each project taught me something that found its way back into writing.

What's one question you keep returning to about how technology shapes the way we work and think?
