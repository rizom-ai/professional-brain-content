Institutions don't protect democracy.

Functioning social contracts do.

We treat constitutions like they're load-bearing structures. They're not. They're suspension of disbelief—agreements we renew every day through participation, trust, and reciprocal obligation.

COVID made this visible in a way nothing else could have.

When the crisis hit, millions willingly abandoned constitutional protections. Not because they were forced. Because the underlying social contract was already broken. We'd stopped trusting institutions to hold up their end of the bargain. So when they asked us to sacrifice, we asked: why should we?

Now we watch institutions fail across sectors—government, education, media, corporations. We blame leadership, incompetence, corruption. Sometimes those are factors.

But the real problem is deeper.

The social contract is fractured. The implicit agreement between institutions and the people they serve has collapsed. Without it, no constitution can save you. No policy can fix it.

Rebuilding a working social contract requires something we've mostly abandoned: reciprocal obligation.

It means institutions actually delivering on their promises. It means people actually participating instead of outsourcing to "experts." It means accepting that we're bound to each other—not just as consumers or citizens, but as people who depend on shared systems to function.

This isn't abstract philosophy. It's the difference between institutions that work and ones that hollow out from the inside.

What would it take to rebuild that contract in one institution you're part of?
