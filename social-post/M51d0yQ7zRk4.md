  Most organizations are built like machines.


  They have clear hierarchies, defined processes, predictable outputs.


  But machines break down when the environment changes faster than the design
  can adapt.


  What if we built differently?


  Cellular automata teach us something profound: simple local rules, applied
  consistently, create complex adaptive systems. No central planner. No rigid
  hierarchy. Just agents responding to their neighbors.


  This isn't new thinking—it's ancient. But it's newly urgent.


  When your organization needs to move at the speed of culture, when knowledge
  is distributed across networks instead of stored in org charts, when the
  future is genuinely unpredictable—machine-like structures fail.


  I've been exploring this for years. How do we design organizations that learn?
  That evolve? That work more like living systems than clockwork?


  Some of my thinking on this is scattered across essays on value, media
  systems, and what work could become:

  https://yeehaa.io/essays/the-future-of-work-is-play


  The underlying conviction: we need structures that respond to local
  conditions, not just execute top-down plans.


  What does this look like in your organization? Where are the places where
  rigid hierarchy breaks down?
