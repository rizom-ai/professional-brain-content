Most networking events are built backwards.

We show up, recite our achievements, and hope someone needs what we're selling.

But what if we inverted it?

What if the conversation started with: "Here's what I actually need right now"?

I've been thinking about this through the lens of ecosystem design. Traditional networking treats people as finished products with fixed value propositions. But living systems work differently—they're organized around flows, needs, and mutual dependencies.

That's the premise behind Superconnectors: a networking format that flips the script entirely.

Instead of pitching accomplishments, you articulate genuine needs. Instead of broadcasting your value, you listen for complementarity. The matching happens naturally—not through resume scanning, but through real problem-solving alignment.

It's less "here's what I do" and more "here's what I'm trying to figure out, and here's what I can offer in return."

I've been exploring how this applies to ecosystem architecture more broadly. When organizations design for need-based matching instead of role-based hierarchy, something shifts. Collaboration becomes more authentic. Resources flow where they're actually needed.

What would change if your next networking event started with vulnerability instead of polish?
