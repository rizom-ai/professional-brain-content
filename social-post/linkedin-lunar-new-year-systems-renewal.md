Lunar New Year reminds us of something institutions have largely forgotten: renewal happens in cycles, not straight lines.

We've built our organizations around linear time—quarterly targets, annual reviews, perpetual growth. But living systems don't work that way. They pulse. They rest. They shed what no longer serves them before growing again.

This is why so many of our institutions feel brittle.

We've optimized for extraction instead of regeneration. We treat people, knowledge, and resources as inputs to be maximized rather than elements in a living ecosystem that needs periodic renewal to stay healthy.

The question isn't whether your organization will reset—it will. The real question is whether you'll do it intentionally or wait for collapse to force it.

Lunar New Year is a practice in intentional renewal. A moment to ask: What habits, structures, and beliefs should we shed? What new growth do we want to cultivate? How do we design for cycles instead of fighting them?

This is ecosystem architecture in action. Not hierarchies or flat networks, but structures that work *with* natural rhythms of creation, stability, and renewal.

I've been exploring these ideas across several essays—from how we innovate as practice to how our tools shape what we can imagine:

What renewal is your organization actually ready for?
