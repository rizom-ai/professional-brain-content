Everyone wants to cure cancer and end poverty.

Google does moonshots. They throw enormous resources at unsolvable problems. That's their playbook—and it works for them.

But somewhere along the way, we started confusing the problem with the solution.

The copycat moonshooters took Google's formula and removed the most important ingredient: the actual resources. What's left? Ego. Lots of it.

Meanwhile, the real work happens elsewhere.

The sweetest fruit isn't on the moon—it's at eye level. It's the small, unglamorous problems that make teams actually function:

- Onboarding that doesn't feel like drowning
- Finding that link someone shared three weeks ago
- Knowing what you missed while you were away

These aren't sexy. They won't get you on a Wired cover. But they're the difference between work that frustrates people and work that flows.

This is what I've learned building Rizom: the most valuable thing you can build is often the simplest thing. Not because we lack ambition, but because we've learned to distinguish between what matters and what impresses.

The low end theory isn't about settling. It's about precision.
