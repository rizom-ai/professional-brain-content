We've been building organizations like machines for centuries.

Precise. Hierarchical. Optimized for efficiency.

But machines break when the world changes. And the world won't stop changing.

What if we designed organizations like living systems instead? Adaptive. Resilient. Capable of learning.

I've been exploring this question through philosophy, code, and years of building communities. The answer isn't about removing structure—it's about structure that breathes.

It's about understanding how knowledge actually flows, how trust actually forms, how communities actually thrive.

I've written about some of these ideas over the years:

https://yeehaa.io/essays/the-future-of-work-is-play
https://yeehaa.io/essays/value-driven-development

Now I'm building Rizom—tools and infrastructure designed from this perspective. Not to replace what works, but to give organizations a different way to think about themselves.

The future of work isn't about better machines.

It's about better ecosystems.

What does that look like in your organization?
