Marty Cagan discusses the concept of visiontypes—prototypes that communicate product vision—and their role in driving innovation. Using the famous example of Steve Jobs' visit to Xerox PARC, Cagan clarifies that Jobs didn't simply "copy" the graphical user interface prototype; rather, the PARC demo inspired his vision of what a desktop computer could become. The article emphasizes that while visiontypes can inspire teams and attract talent, the real work of innovation comes through extensive problem and solution discovery after the vision is established. Cagan draws from his own experience at HP Labs, where the team was similarly inspired by PARC and MIT's Media Lab, but ultimately failed to productize their vision of "the domesticated computer" due to poor enabling technology choices. The key insight is that creating a compelling vision is only the beginning; the ability to discover and deliver actual products that provide customer value is what truly defines innovation.
