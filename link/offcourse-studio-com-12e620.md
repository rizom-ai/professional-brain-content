Offcourse Studio works with organizations to develop technology that genuinely serves their needs through a three-step process: mapping existing data and knowledge ecosystems, strategizing infrastructure improvements, and intervening with custom tools and services. Founded by Jan Hein Hoogstad, a philosopher and software architect, the studio specializes in creating personalized learning systems, AI-powered bots with personality, data validation systems, and other solutions that blend creative potential with ethical considerations. Their approach treats technology as an additional dimension that can visualize multiple outcomes and possibilities, drawing on diverse expertise across education, cultural institutions, and international networks.
