Offcourse Studio is a creative technology practice founded by Jan Hein Hoogstad that designs and implements intelligent tools and systems for organizations. The studio works through a three-phase methodology: mapping existing data and knowledge ecosystems, strategizing infrastructure improvements, and intervening with custom tools like personalized AI assistants and ethical certification systems. Their work spans projects like "Bots with an Attitude" (AI assistants for artistic researchers) and "Public Badges" (an ethical values certification system for internet products), demonstrating their commitment to making technology that is creative, ethical, and genuinely useful.

Jan Hein brings a unique background combining philosophy, media studies, software architecture, and international experience across multiple continents. His approach treats technology not as a replacement for human effort, but as a creative partner that helps organizations focus on critical challenges rather than routine tasks.
