## Description
Superconnectors is a networking event platform that breaks away from traditional pitch formats by connecting startups with well-connected individuals who can provide game-changing introductions to solve critical business challenges.

## Summary
Superconnectors is a unique networking event format designed to move beyond typical startup pitches. Instead of presenting achievements, founders present their most critical asks—the key challenges or connections they need to overcome. A curated audience of "superconnectors" (well-connected individuals) then compete to provide the best introductions from their networks to address these asks. The event operates in three stages: Ask (startups present their critical need), Bid (superconnectors offer relevant connections), and Connect (matches are made immediately). The platform is gamified end-to-end and has hosted 20 events, connected 100 startups with over 1,000 superconnectors, resulting in 100+ breakthrough connections. The events are free to participate in and are supported by partners including Gemeente Rotterdam, CitizenM, and Weave.
