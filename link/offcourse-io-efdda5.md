Offcourse is an open source platform designed to democratize online learning by allowing users to curate the best sources from across the internet—blogs, video tutorials, podcasts—and organize them into structured, easy-to-share courses. The platform facilitates "crowdlearning," a community-driven approach where individuals share knowledge they've learned and benefit from knowledge shared by others. Founded by an international team with diverse educational backgrounds, Offcourse supports both learners and trainers with tools to explore courses across design, programming, and other 21st century skills. The platform emphasizes the philosophy that sharing knowledge promotes growth and development for everyone involved.
