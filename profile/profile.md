## Intro

Essays on ecosystem architecture, institutional decay, and the practice of building inhabitable futures.

## Story

I came to technology through philosophy. After years of studying continental thought—Heidegger, Bataille, Benjamin, Kittler—I realized that the most interesting questions about knowledge, community, and meaning were no longer being asked in academia. They were being answered, for better or worse, by the people building our digital infrastructure.

So I started building. First Offcourse, an open source learning platform that tried to reimagine education outside institutional walls. Then bootcamps and education technology, learning firsthand how hard it is to create spaces where people can actually grow. Each project taught me something about what makes communities thrive or collapse.

Now I'm building Rizom and Brains—tools for thought that help individuals and organizations create, connect, and share knowledge. The underlying conviction hasn't changed: we need new structures that work in less mechanical, less hierarchical, less instrumental ways. Not because hierarchy is inherently bad, but because our tools and contexts have evolved beyond what traditional organizational models can handle.

I call this practice ecosystem architecture: designing and cultivating organizations as if they were living systems rather than machines. It's informed by everything from Afrofuturism to Shanzhai culture, from DAOs to mesh networks. The goal isn't to restore some imagined golden age, but to build something genuinely new.
