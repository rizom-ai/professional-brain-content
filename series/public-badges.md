# Public Badges

## Description
Public Badges transforms how organizations communicate trust and values in digital spaces by making implicit expectations explicit. This series explores how badge systems can align stakeholder values, rebuild trust without restrictive security measures, and create transparent frameworks where organizations prove their commitments rather than merely claiming them. Discover how small, visible signals can fundamentally reshape how communities relate to the institutions they depend on.
