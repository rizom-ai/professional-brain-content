description: >-
  Explore how organizations and communities can be designed as living systems
  rather than machines. This series examines ecosystem architecture as a
  practice—drawing from philosophy, nature, and decentralized cultures—to build
  inhabitable futures that embrace fragmentation, regeneration, and collective
  emergence over top-down control.
