  Explore how to design organizations and communities as living systems rather
  than machines. This series examines ecosystem architecture—blending
  decentralization, regenerative design, and complexity theory—to build
  inhabitable futures that embrace fragmentation, honor multiplicity, and create
  structures where people can genuinely thrive.
