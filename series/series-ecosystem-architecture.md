slug: ecosystem-architecture
description: >-
  Ecosystem Architecture explores how organizations and communities can be
  designed as living systems rather than machines—embracing fragmentation,
  decentralization, and regenerative practices to create multiple inhabitable
  futures. Through philosophical inquiry and practical frameworks, this series
  examines the tools, cultures, and mindsets needed to build structures that
  thrive through alignment and emergence rather than control. From surveillance
  capitalism to shanzhai manufacturing to permaculture, discover how ecosystem
  thinking offers a radical alternative to extraction and hierarchy.
