  Ecosystem Architecture explores how to design organizations and communities as
  living systems rather than machines, moving beyond surveillance capitalism and
  extractive models toward regenerative, decentralized structures. From
  fragmented digital networks to permaculture principles and startup societies,
  this series charts a practice for building inhabitable futures through
  alignment, emergence, and collective intelligence.
