# Ecosystem Architecture

## Description
Explore how organizations and communities can be designed as living systems rather than machines. This series unpacks ecosystem architecture—a practice that embraces decentralization, regenerative design, and multiplicity to build inhabitable futures against surveillance capitalism and rigid hierarchies. From Shenzhen's peer-to-peer manufacturing to permaculture principles, discover frameworks for creating thriving, non-hierarchical structures that work with complexity instead of against it.
