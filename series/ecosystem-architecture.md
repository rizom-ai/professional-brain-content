# Ecosystem Architecture

## Description
Explore how decentralized, regenerative systems can replace outdated organizational models in an increasingly fragmented world. This series traces ecosystem architecture from philosophy to practice—examining surveillance capitalism, digital fragmentation, and nature-based design—to show how we can build inhabitable futures that thrive through alignment rather than control.
