# Ecosystem Architecture

## Description
Explore how decentralized ecosystems, regenerative design, and new organizational models are reshaping how we build communities, share knowledge, and create futures beyond surveillance capitalism. This series examines the philosophy, practice, and real-world examples of ecosystem architecture—a framework for designing organizations that work like living systems rather than machines, from Shenzhen's manufacturing networks to digital communities transcending geography.
