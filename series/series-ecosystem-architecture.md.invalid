  Explore how ecosystem architecture reimagines organizations as living systems
  that transcend traditional hierarchies and geographical boundaries. This
  series traces the philosophical and practical foundations—from
  decentralization and regenerative design to surveillance capitalism and
  cultural fragmentation—to build inhabitable futures through intentional
  community design and alignment.
