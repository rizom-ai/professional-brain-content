# New Institutions

## Description
Institutions are failing—not because they're old, but because their social contracts have broken down. This series explores how decentralized tools, aligned values, and living systems thinking can rebuild the trust and accountability that traditional structures promised but no longer deliver, offering practical frameworks for creating organizations that actually work.
