# New Institutions

## Description
Institutions are broken, but the tools to rebuild them are here. This series explores how decentralized systems, aligned values, and new social contracts can create organizations that actually work—moving beyond hierarchical structures toward living systems that adapt, trust, and thrive. Discover what comes next when we stop defending the old and start building what's actually inhabitable.
