## Context

42Workspace is Rotterdam's premier coworking space, serving as a central hub for the city's tech startup and innovation community. The facility was designed to address a fundamental gap in Rotterdam's ecosystem: while the city had technical talent and entrepreneurial energy, it lacked a physical and social infrastructure where these forces could connect and collaborate. The space operates as both a practical workspace provider and a community architect, hosting everything from day-pass users to private office tenants, while maintaining an active calendar of networking events, tech talks, pitch competitions, and hackathons.

## Problem

Rotterdam's tech community was fragmented. Startups, scale-ups, and freelancers had access to desk space, but lacked meaningful connection to each other and to the broader innovation ecosystem. Traditional office rentals offered isolation rather than community. Existing coworking spaces treated community as an afterthought—a social calendar added to an office building—rather than the core value proposition. The city needed infrastructure that could simultaneously serve practical workspace needs while actively cultivating the relationships, knowledge sharing, and collaborative momentum that drives innovation ecosystems.

## Solution

42Workspace was built as an integrated ecosystem combining three interconnected layers: **Physical Infrastructure** offering flexible membership options (day passes at €20 to private offices at €375/month) with modern facilities including high-speed internet, meeting rooms, a fully equipped gym, 24/7 access, and a rooftop event space designed for community gathering. **Digital Community Infrastructure** through a dedicated community app that enables members to connect, share opportunities, and coordinate collaboration beyond physical proximity. **Active Ecosystem Programming** through a consistent calendar of events—meetups, tech talks, pitch competitions, and hackathons—that create repeated touchpoints for connection and knowledge exchange. Critically, 42Workspace positioned itself as a partner to Rotterdam's broader innovation infrastructure, actively collaborating with innovation hubs, investors, and local authorities to ensure the space functioned as a node in a larger network rather than an isolated venue.

## Outcome

42Workspace established itself as Rotterdam's leading coworking destination and became a catalytic node in the city's tech ecosystem. By treating community infrastructure as the primary product rather than an amenity, the space successfully attracted and retained a diverse cross-section of the tech community—from early-stage founders to scaling teams. The combination of flexible pricing, quality facilities, and consistent programming created a self-reinforcing cycle where members experienced genuine professional benefit from proximity to other members, generating organic word-of-mouth growth. The active partnership approach with local innovation partners positioned 42Workspace as a trusted hub within Rotterdam's broader economic development strategy, demonstrating how physical community infrastructure can serve as a practical tool for ecosystem development.
