It hasn't\nled to the promised breakthroughs, while other solvable real-world problems\nare being ignored.\n\n---\n\n### Our Approach\n\n**Radical Automation**: Automate every laborious and boring chore that can be\nautomated. Any missed opportunity to do so inevitably results in talent waste.\n\n**Human In The Loop**: On collaborative messaging apps, it is childishly simple\nto put an AI in a continuous feedback loop with its users.\n\n**Low-Hanging Fruit**: While hardly ever successful, most AI initiatives focus\non moonshots. We take the opposite approach—deliberately tackling the 90% first.\n\n---\n\n### AI Stack\n\n| Layer | Technology |\n| ----- | ---------- |\n| NLP | spaCy, Compromise |\n| Classification | TensorFlow.js |\n| Rules | Custom rule engines |\n| Integration | Slack, Microsoft Teams |\n\n---\n\n## In Practice\n\n---\n\n### Feature Development Flow\n\n1.
