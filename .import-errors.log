COVID revealed that\n  constitutions were mere suspension of disbelief. This article introduces a new\n  series on rebuilding civil societies with decentralized tools, grounded in\n  aligned values and functioning social contracts.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: New Institutions\nseriesIndex: 1\n---\nThere was a time, not long ago, when I was convinced that we should uphold our public institutions by any means necessary. As a political philosopher, I was instilled with the belief that our political system, the law, educational structures, and ultimately the constitution served as our defense against anti-democratic forces.\n\nToday, however, I no longer hold that belief. Why? Because it has been repeatedly falsified by empirical evidence—evidence we have collectively chosen to ignore. It is high time we acknowledge this reality.\n\nThe left often argues that institutional decay results from the right's abuse of the system. While this perspective may have held some validity 10 to 15 years ago, it no longer stands today. I constantly witness equal disregard from all sides of the political spectrum. Institutions are only recognized as legitimate authorities when they serve particular interests. They are easily dismissed when they are not. Israel's disregard for UN resolutions, and the subsequent lack of meaningful consequences, represents perhaps the most blatant example of this institutional bankruptcy.\n\nFor me personally, the COVID pandemic served as a watershed moment. I was — and remain — stunned that people who supposedly understood the importance of constitutional protections for our political system were willing to set them aside for the possibility that their grandparent might live marginally longer. This observation isn't intended as moral judgment; rather, it demonstrates that the constitution never actually functioned as an effective safeguard against populism or fascism. It was merely a suspension of disbelief:the \"Disneyfication\" of our democracy at its peak.\n\nThis raises a critical question: if our public institutions haven't been the constitution that protected our constitutional democracies for approximately 70 years, what has?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is straightforward: a functioning social contract. In other words, the constitution has never been truly constitutional. The true bedrock of a healthy state was never its institutions, but rather the shared, aligned values to which most citizens subscribed. Institutions are built upon a functional social contract—and it is precisely this social contract that lies broken today.\n\nThe implications are profound. We cannot simply repair our existing institutions; we must reconsider the fundamental agreements that underpin them. This task requires not just institutional reform but renewed conversations about our collective values and commitments. Only by rebuilding social contracts — mind the plural — can we hope to establish institutions capable of withstanding the challenges of our deeply divided era.\n\nThis upcoming series of articles is an attempt to recast the urgent flaws and of the failing system into ripe opportunities to build better ones. Our current institutions were designed with time and place bound tools and practices of the industrial age. Today we have asynchronous and decentralized alternatives at our disposals. It would be foolish not to build our civil societies on top of them.\n\nUnderneath all this flashy technological prowess, however, should lie a solid foundation. One that consists of strong common values that need constant debate and negotiation. This process of alignment will result in a constitution that balances individual rights with shared responsibilities. Effective institutions will always need to be built on a functioning social contract.\n","metadata":{"title":"Urging New Institutions","slug":"urging-new-institutions","status":"published","publishedAt":"2025-12-02T09:00:00.000Z","seriesName":"New Institutions","seriesIndex":1},"created":1764605320883,"updated":1764605555183,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Urging New Institutions","rootJobId":"hkaJUoNkmYg0"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787700,1765728787700,,

The challenge: building a community of people that may never be in the same place at the same time. The solution: a mob of bots with an attitude.\n\nPlanet B is a thought experiment. It proposes an imaginative scenario: a mission to colonize a recently discovered habitable planet. This planetary expedition requires remote collaboration among team members dispersed across the globe. Rather than relying solely on human team members, I proposed complementing the human members of our team with a mob of bots.\n\nThe core thesis shifts focus from humanness to agency. What matters in collaborative work is whether an agent effectively contributes to expedition goals, regardless of whether they're human or artificial. This perspective raises several philosophical questions:\n\nDoes it matter whether a coworker is human if their contributions are valuable?\n\nDoes humanness become irrelevant if it endangers the mission?\n\nHow do we govern an agent network that includes both humans and bots?\n\nThe piece acknowledges practical challenges including bot autonomy, bot-to-bot communication risks, and governance structures needed for such hybrid teams. Planet B serves as a counterfactual space to explore these questions safely before real-world implementation.\n\nIn thinking through these challenges, we confront fundamental assumptions about collaboration, intelligence, and what it means to be a productive member of a team. The answers we develop in this imaginary space may well inform how we design the collaborative systems of tomorrow.\n","metadata":{"title":"Agency Trumps Humanness","slug":"agency-trumps-humanness","status":"published","publishedAt":"2020-04-30T00:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764051398100,"updated":1764265349231,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Agency Trumps Humanness","rootJobId":"InJuaVhE9Q0K"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787702,1765728787702,,

Journalism never was the same to me again. Why read about the horrors of acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer, when there was a newspaper that covered sightings of Marilyn Monroe and Bat Boy instead?\n\nObviously, my own journalistic endeavors had to follow suit. Being the editor-in-chief of the school newspaper, I started to take inspiration from my newly discovered favorite news source. Why stick to the bare facts when they can be infused with all the wonderful rumors and anecdotes that are floating around? Isn't good fiction worth more than the boring truth?\n\nMy piece de resistance: a Dear Mary item that featured letters from the teaching staff. Our Mary — named Hans — gave the English teacher some much needed tough love about his financial problems, but was also warm and understanding when the Gym teacher opened up about his sexual frustrations. Generoso Pope Jr. would have been proud.\n\nAlas, the dean was of a different opinion. After two marvelous issues, I was forcefully removed from my post.\n\nAlthough I was clearly not amused by his actions at the time, in retrospect, I would argue that the dean handled the problem of fake news in an exemplary manner. The key to his success: his actions were not focused on the news itself, but on the agent that spread it.\n\nFor Planet B, I am in the process of turning the dean into an algorithm. On an abstract level, the steps that it consists of look like this:\n\n1. Associate a concrete piece of information to a particular agent.\n2. Adjust the reputation score of this agent according to the quality of its contribution (post, comment, like, etc.).\n3. Amplify or quieten the reach of the contribution based on the agent's reputation score.\n4. Remove the agent from discourse if its reputation drops below a threshold.\n\nThe aim of such an Organic Governance System is to improve the quality of the conversations within our online community.

This article concludes the series by\n  advocating ecosystem architecture as the practice to design multiple\n  inhabitable futures against predetermined dystopias.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 11\n---\nEcosystem architecture encourages us to invest in futures that we would like to inhabit rather than settling for the one we expect to become reality. From its inception, the true promise of the decentralized internet has been the multiplication of public and private spaces. More importantly, we acquired an unrivaled degree of ownership over them. We did not lose the internet due to fragmentation, but because we started outsourcing our responsibility to take care of it to governments and corporations. It is high time to reclaim it.\n\nWhile the internet is irrecoverably shattered, I sincerely believe that it is still possible to prevent the tectonic plates from further drifting apart. However, the odds are rapidly stacking against us. Without swift and clear interventions, we will be destined for a future that is already being written for us.\n\nThe name of that story is _Surveillance Capitalism_. In her book of the same title, Shoshana Zuboff succinctly captures its essence:\n\n> Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.\n\nJust as the proponents of a unified internet, corporations and governments strive to connect the unconnected, since persistent online access helps them gather larger amounts of more granular data. In the age of surveillance capitalism, these former adversaries have found a shared interest in gaining control over people's behavior. Data is their weapon of choice. By analyzing vast behavioral patterns, they can more easily predict and preempt people's actions. Naively giving people more and better access to the internet only feeds into this vicious cycle of exploitation.\n\nTo prevent this future, we must first align the misaligned before connecting the unconnected. Alignment, however, does not start with asking people what they want. Alignment is the process of figuring out what people need, shaping tangible futures from these needs, and then finally give them the option to choose between them. Without a proper palette of possible alternatives, people will only repeat the most probable outcome — and the most probable narrative is always the one that fortifies the current status quo.\n\nWhether it is cryptocurrencies, virtual and augmented reality, or artificial intelligence, loud alarm bells should ring whenever we are presented with a supposedly inevitable future. In these instances, we must first ask: Who is presenting this future? How is this person, network, or organization situated? And what interest do they have in the realization of this future?\n\nThese questions are not only important for present futures but equally applicable to past ones. In \"Further Considerations on Afrofuturism\", Kodwo Eshun makes a strong case for the importance of reading these counter-futures:\n\n> By creating temporal complications and anachronistic episodes that disturb the linear time of progress, these futurisms adjust the temporal logics that condemned black subjects to prehistory. Chronopolitically speaking, these revisionist histories may be understood as a series of powerful competing futures that infiltrate the present at different rates.\n\nPast futurists are our future allies. They can teach us to reject the logic of a future that has already been written for us. The only way to avoid bleak dystopian scenarios is to keep imagining, shaping, and performing better alternatives. What distinguishes our current reality is that we no longer need to settle for a one-size-fits-all model of the future. Multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values can peacefully coexist. These spaces, however, will not appear out of nowhere. They need to be designed, developed, and nurtured. Ecosystem architecture is the practice that does exactly that.\n","metadata":{"title":"Reclaiming The Future","slug":"reclaiming-the-future","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-11-12T08:27:26.648Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":11},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349242,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Reclaiming The Future","rootJobId":"J0ntcdwoYVJR"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787706,1765728787706,,

This article explores how filter bubbles can be\n  understood as potential ecosystems rather than problems to burst, embracing\n  complexity without universal norms.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 5\n---\nEveryday language is overloaded with conceptual metaphors that either celebrate the whole or lament its absence: broken heart, phantom pain, paradise lost, etcetera. The fact that these sentiments are so deeply ingrained into our means of communication also explains why it is so difficult to let universality go. This is already true _de facto_, let alone _de jure_. Even if we are willing to submit ourselves to the existential fact of living without absolute truth, it is still probable that we conceive its absence as a loss. Reframing fragmentation as something positive is next to impossible.\n\nThat is why it is admirable that Peter Sloterdijk takes on this challenge against all odds. In the third volume of his Spheres trilogy titled _Foams_ (1998), he introduces the titular concept as an antipode to those conceptual metaphors that signify wholeness, unity, and completeness. Foam is a phenomenon that celebrates multiplicity. As a concept, it defies all notions of universality without even referring to it negatively.\n\n> The foam metaphor has the merit of capturing the topological allocation of creative and self-securing creations of living space in an image. It not only reminds us of the tight proximity between fragile units, but also of the necessary self-enclosure of each foam cell, even though they can only exist as users of shared separation installations\n\n— Peter Sloterdijk\n\nThe desire to reverse the effects of separation repeats trauma and causes paralysis. The will to celebrate multiplicity leads to empowerment and creativity. It is an affirmative act.\n\nLet's demonstrate the power of this affirmative act by applying it to the concept of 'internet fragmentation' that I explored in an [earlier article](/posts/align-the-misaligned) Following Sloterdijk's logic, refering to this process in terms of fragmentation confronts us with an unsolvable problem. Fragments only have meaning in relation to a whole that was never there, is experienced as lost, and can never be restored. By simply calling it internet foaming instead, we immediately reframe this entire narrative.\n\nSloterdijk's foam metaphor offers a compelling framework for understanding our increasingly complex and interconnected world. The internet, with its myriad websites, social media platforms, and online communities, bears a striking resemblance to foam. Each digital space functions as a bubble within this vast foam structure - self-contained yet inextricably linked to others.\n\nHence, it is not a coincidence that bubbles play a crucial role in the internet's short history. The 1990s witnessed the rise of the infamous dot-com bubble, closely intertwined with the burgeoning landscape of the OG internet. This economic phenomenon, symbolized by an exuberant surge in the valuation of internet-based companies, eventually reached a critical point in 2000 when it abruptly burst. The collapse of the dot-com bubble sent shockwaves across the global economy, ushering in a period of recession that reverberated worldwide.\n\nIn recent years, the pervasive influence of filter bubbles has enveloped us. The concept of filter bubbles revolves around the idea that biased algorithms curate content based on user behavior, thereby creating echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and isolate individuals from diverse perspectives. While this tailored digital experience caters to our immediate wants and needs, it concurrently impedes and restricts the potential for meaningful connections with others. Instagram and TikTok trapped us in monad without windows.\n\nOr so we have been told! But is the issue of filter bubbles really a problem of today? Is it truly an internet problem? Television, radio, newspapers, and librarians were — and are — highly selective in their choices; the Lonely Planet lured the entire Western world to the same hostel in Thailand, and the whole concept of a literary canon is quite literally a massive filter bubble. In other words, the modern internet invented neither the economy nor the politics of information: it simply intensified its use, multiplied the amount of bubbles, and rendered its effects more apparent.\n\nMore importantly, it is too easy to only focus on the problems. Filter bubbles are not merely determined by misinformation and ignorance, but also by shared values. The inhabitants of these ecosystems relate to each other through what they have in common. They choose to live in a bubble because, for them, it signifies connectedness, commonality, and solidarity. In their purest form bubbles are seeds; they are potential ecosystems.\n\nPopping filter bubbles would thus mean throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Let's stay in the warm and foamy jacuzzi, while increasing our awareness of its inherent problems. The most undesirable side effects of filter bubbles are two sides of the same coin:\n\n**Entrapment**: The problem of being confined in a bubble where you do not belong. While people can derive incredible support and meaning from shared common values, being trapped in a community with values that are opposed to your own, or even actively threatening your existence, can feel like a prison.\n\n**Solipsism**: This is the condition where you genuinely believe that your bubble is the one and only. If you are too enamored by your community's values, you are bound to overlook its limitations and problems. Every ecosystem is defined by boundaries. A bubble that is good for you can be stifling, or even harmful, to someone else.\n\nFrom now onward, the challenge lies in solving these problems without reentering the arena of universal values and norms. As soon as we start bursting bubbles again — either that of someone else or our own — foam reveals its most important characteristic: it has no outside. There is no bird's eye point of view. The outside of a bubble is another bubble. As soon as we truly accept this existential fact, we stop bursting bubbles and begin to foster ecosystems.\n","metadata":{"title":"Foam Party","slug":"foam-party","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-09-02T07:51:14.186Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":5},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349246,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Foam Party","rootJobId":"GFpbdfqjLxUn"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787708,1765728787708,,

This\n  article explores how ecosystem architecture can embrace this fragmentation as\n  an opportunity for innovation rather than a problem to solve.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 3\n---\nIt is remarkable how the history of virtual space mimics that of its physical counterpart. Like the universe's big bang, or better yet, the earth's tectonic shifts, our once one and only internet has shattered into many pieces. To lead with the bad news: no attempt to glue its pieces back together will ever mend it into a whole again. But the fact that something is broken does not mean that it is worthless. Changing our relation to fragments and waste is key to our planetary future. So why exclude the internet from our newfound consciousness?\n\nThis insight is key to the practice of ecosystem architecture: an approach that views digital landscapes as complex, interconnected systems akin to natural ecosystems. Just as natural ecosystems thrive on diversity and complex interdependencies, ecosystem architecture posits that our digital ecosystems must embrace fragmentation and diversity as opportunities for growth and innovation rather than as obstacles to overcome.\n\nWhile the existence and dangers of the Chinese and Russian internet are widely known and debated, the prevalence of this discourse obscures the fact that our 'normal' internet experience has been far from the norm globally for quite a while. In most Asian countries, so-called superapps have replaced browsers and apps as the primary way to interact with the web. Africa is pioneering the adoption of mesh and peer-to-peer networks that creatively give (some form of) internet access to people who cannot afford or rely on stable and persistent connections. Even our own mobile app store ecosystems should be understood as a break from the Open Global Web, which itself thus needs to be further predicated: let's call it the OG internet for now.\n\nTo understand how we arrived at this fragmented state, we need to look back at the internet's evolution, which has been far from uniform across the globe. Its history reflects both technological advancements and geopolitical realities, with roots tracing back to its very origins in the United States. While the ARPANET-DARPANET split in the United States represents an early instance of fragmentation, the global story is far more diverse and nuanced, with Europe developing unique academic networks, France pioneering Minitel, and Africa leapfrogging directly to mobile networks.\n\nEven the debate around internet fragmentation is nothing new, dating back to the browser wars of the mid-1990s. However, it heated significantly around 2013, when Edward Snowden's revelations turned a gradual drift into a maelstrom of concerns about internet governance and privacy. To better understand the nature of this fragmentation, we can turn to a study from the World Economic Forum published in 2016. This research identified three distinct types of internet fragmentation:\n\n**Technical Fragmentation**: Conditions in the underlying infrastructure that impede the ability of systems to fully interoperate and exchange data packets and of the Internet to function consistently at all endpoints.\n\n**Governmental Fragmentation**: Government policies and actions that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources.\n\n**Commercial Fragmentation**: Business practices that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources.\n\nRecognizing the challenges posed by these forms of fragmentation, the Internet Society (ISOC) has put tremendous effort into making these concerns actionable and putting them on the political agenda. Its aim is to 'connect the unconnected' by fostering a more connected and interoperable online environment.\n\nDespite these efforts, when mainstream media and public intellectuals assimilate the issue of internet fragmentation, a lot of the nuance and pragmatism gets lost in translation. More precisely, the status quo centers its narrative on restoring the OG Internet. It focuses on what the web was rather than on what it can be. Proponents of this restorative stance can be roughly divided into three camps:\n\n**Past Dwellers**: Pioneers who have a strong investment in, and are highly nostalgic for, the internet's early days. They consider the web's inception as an exemplary moment in history when free and open global discourse was, and could have stayed, a reality.\n\n**Power Mongers**: Stakeholders whose (geo)political power can be challenged, stabilized, or expanded through control of the internet. These are mainly countries located in the Global North.\n\n**Gold Diggers**: Parties that benefit economically from the OG internet. This camp mostly consists of companies that provide 'free' services that are paid for with data.\n\nWhile these perspectives dominate much of the discourse around internet fragmentation, they often overlook the potential benefits and inevitability of some degree of fragmentation in a diverse global context. This brings us back to the importance of ecosystem architecture as a framework for understanding and navigating our current digital landscape.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of internet fragmentation, such as barriers to global communication or the creation of echo chambers, it's equally crucial to recognize the positive effects and innovative solutions that have emerged from this diversification. These include localized innovation, improved access in underserved areas, enhanced privacy and data sovereignty, cultural preservation, and potential resilience against cyber threats.\n\nA critical reflection of the OG Internet's promises, the conditions under which this assumed historical exception could appear, and the reasons for its quick demise, is long overdue. As soon as the rest of the world got access to the web, the clash of civilizations immediately turned into a full-blown culture war. If anything, the internet's short history has made it crystal clear that open access to all information does not lead to universal consensus, trust, and understanding. Quite the opposite, it has led to an explosion of propaganda, fake news, and identity politics.\n\nIn light of these challenges and opportunities, the future of the internet, like any thriving ecosystem, lies in fostering connections that enhance mutual growth and understanding while respecting diversity. By adopting principles of ecosystem architecture, we can design a digital world that is more resilient, inclusive, and adaptive to the needs of all its inhabitants. This means not only acknowledging the fragmented reality but also leveraging it to build a more robust and dynamic internet for the future - one that celebrates innovation and diversity while addressing the challenges of fragmentation head-on.\n","metadata":{"title":"Align The Misaligned","slug":"align-the-misaligned","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-08-19T09:17:01.023Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":3},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349249,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Align The Misaligned","rootJobId":"tZfqvyul4C7R"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787710,1765728787710,,

The single roman numeral signifies the almost religious belief in exponential logic that both X and its mother company hold. X promises to only invest in ideas that could make at least a 10x impact over the status quo.\n\nThe projects that X engages with are appropriately named moonshots. A term first introduced in Jules Verne's *From the Earth to the Moon* but popularized by president John F. Kennedy in 1961. In his famous speech, Kennedy promised congress that he would get a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Moreover, and equally important, the president also pledged to bring this man back safely to earth. Eight years and $25.4 billion dollars—that would equate to $150 billion in today's economy—later, Apollo 11 managed to fulfill that promise.\n\nX takes this idea one step further by referring to itself as a moonshot factory. The company doesn't just embark on nearly impossible missions, but aims to make these journeys mass-producible. Its mission does not consist of solving one *particular* impossible problem, but finding the recipe to solve *any* impossible problem. X's blueprint for producing moonshots consists of three simple, repeatable steps:\n\n1. Focus on an unsolvable problem\n2. Spend a shitload of money on it\n3. Sell the resulting solution\n\nOver a decade later, we can indisputably conclude that X's moonshot recipe has led to a massive amount of inspiring Wired covers. Whereas world's biggest problems seem to be as unsolvable as 10 years ago. But hey, those Google Glasses do make you look cool while cruising your Waymo, right?\n\n## Counterfeit Moon Shooters\n\n> Rake in dividends\n> Let the money stack\n> See you copycats\n\n— Brockhampton\n\nMore impressive than the actual solutions that it has produced, may be the amount of copy cats that X has inspired since then. Over the last decade, many an agency, incubator, or VC firm has reinvented itself as a moonshot factory.\n\nWhile the marketing material of these counterfeit moon shooters was mostly copied one-to-one from X's website, closer inspection reveals that they did in fact make some small but significant changes to the original formula. In true Shenzhen fashion, they added a few features and removed some others.\n\n1. Focus on a fashionable problem\n2. Ask for an outrageous amount of money\n\nAs we speak, the tech world is overflowing with aspiring moon shooters searching for generous sponsors and benevolent donors. Entrepreneurs no longer look for investors to fund their solutions. Instead, they look for those that will let them solve the world's biggest problems. Give these aspiring Elon Musks enough money and they will cure cancer, stop famine, and end poverty. Or so they claim.

This article explores how modern\n  organizations require new frameworks of ecosystem architecture to design and\n  cultivate thriving, non-hierarchical structures.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 1\n---\nIn biology, an ecosystem is confined to a particular space and time. It is bound to the specific geographic area where a community of living organisms interacts with their physical environment. This space can vary greatly in size, from a small pond, to an expansive forest, or a vast ocean. Each ecosystem is characterized by its unique combination of biotic actors, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and abiotic factors, including climate, soil, water, and topography which can and will change over time. The spatio-temporal boundaries of a biological ecosystem are crucial because they determine the specific interactions and relationships among organisms.\n\nUp until this day, these ecological roots of the word ecosystem have also shaped its hyped, non-literal use. In fact, the metaphor has been overused and stretched to such extend that it has become a source of both nuisance and ridicule:\n\n> Every crypto has a bloody 'ecosystem'. Like you're embarking on some excursion into the Brazilian rainforest, and there's speckled finch and poison dart frogs communing with Bernese pythons and friggin orangutans. There is nothing ecological about crypto. There's no birds of paradise. David Attenborough is not there to narrate the mating rituals of Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hodgkins.\n\n— [ZombieSlayer83](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmng04/ecosystem_is_the_most_cringe_word_in_all_of_crypto/)\n\nWhile quotes like this are definitely cringeworthy, I actually believe that the inflation of the term ecosystem is symptomatic of a positive, underlying phenomenon. In fact, it is not the hype that made it a hypernym, but rather the exact opposite. People feel the need to overuse the word ecosystem because other, prevalent terms to describe human organizations are no longer fitting. Company, network, platform, association, circle, pact, club, company, community, consortium, corporation, establishment, federation, institute, league, party, society, team, family, tribe, union: all fail to capture the zeitgeist.\n\nThe increased use of the term ecosystem signifies a shift in the wishes and expectations that we hold of organizations. People desire structures that work in less mechanical, less hierarchical, less instrumental ways. The word ecosystem, with its organic connotations, easily lends itself to be approriated to fulfill this craving.\n\n> Organizations are living systems that reflect the consciousness of their members.\n\n— [Frederic Laloux](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)\n\nHowever, the same etymology that explains the word's appeal also keeps us from understanding its full potential. Artistic, societal, and business ecosystems do not merely mimic biological ones. They also go way beyond them. So far, the decisive shift in the meaning of the term has mostly been overlooked. As opposed to their biological counterparts, contemporary ecosystems transcend the mere contingent. They have expanded to forms of organization no longer bound to a contiguous territory, but are dispersed across space and time.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that this shift in meaning happened parallel to the rise and subsequent shattering of the global internet. The last three decades have seen an explosion of possibilities to create networks, ventures, and communities that are distributed and asynchronous. But this dispersion also made it clear that healthy non-natural ecosystems do not just organically come into fruition and thrive.\n\n> The Internet isn’t just a technology, it’s an ecosystem. Learning to really see the Internet— its structure and pieces —can help us better care for it.\n\n— [Michelle Ciccone](https://commonplace.knowledgefutures.org/pub/4ie859tv/release/2)\n\nEcosystems need to be designed and cultivated, but in an unforced, open-ended manner. Current day business and management frameworks increasingly fall short in creating thriving organizations and networks, because they fail to meet people's growing desire for organic, non-hierarchical structures. Resorting to ancient agricultural models is not the answer either, since farming and gardening were never meant to work across space and time. In order to groom successful decentralized organizations new conceptual models, skills, and tools are needed. I will call this practice ecosystem architecture.\n\nEcosystem architecture draws its inspiration from many sources: philosophy, gender studies, coding, spirituality, music, dance, visual arts, media theory to name a few. While this mix may seem eclectic or even erratic, there is actually reason to the madness. Natural ecosystems thrive on biodiversity and so do their conceptual antipodes. In order to tackle the challenges ahead of us, no single discipline or practice possesses all the knowledge and wisdom needed. And since ecosystems are wild and eclectic, so are their theoretical underpinnings.\n\nThis upcoming series of articles will explore ecosystems architecture's origins, inspirations, and practical applications through the lens of internet fragmentation. It will reevaluate dominant notions of innovation in light of their cultural and environmental costs, extending our growing ecological consciousness beyond the physical into the virtual. The series will show how the vibrant world of Afrofuturism challenges predictive algorithms, how the Network State uses blockchain to rewrite history, and why the dynamic Shanzhai culture of Shenzhen had disrupted Western notions of intellectual property. By examining these pioneering decentralized and regenerative practices, we will learn how to create diverse, innovative, resilient, and thriving ecosystems.\n","metadata":{"title":"Across Space And Time","slug":"across-space-and-time","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-07-01T08:43:33.622Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":1},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349252,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Across Space And Time","rootJobId":"70yRsQH24c3p"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787713,1765728787713,,

In this post, I explain how Public Badges\n  build on this practice by rendering the implicit values behind these\n  expectations explicit.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Public Badges\nseriesIndex: 2\n---\n> 'Cause anything's possible, yeah\n> There's no code of ethics out here\n\n— Drake\n\nThere has been no shortage lately of stories about the tech industry's questionable ethics. We all read the stories. A smart security camera company is working with law enforcement to create an unofficial surveillance network. Tech executives photoshop female executives into their snapshots of a field trip before sharing them on instagram. The algorithm of a new credit card determines credit limits on the basis of gender. And the list goes on and on.\n\nStill, while the critique of immorality may apply to the upper echelons of the well-known big corporations, I believe it to be an unfair assessment of the industry as a whole. While ethics is not always at the forefront of every developer's mind, it is a mistake to conclude that her work is thus immoral. Heck, I would not even call it amoral.\n\nA lot of software development — especially Open Source Software (OSS) development — is driven by values. From the Google Engineer that aims to make the web more accessible, the Facebook Developer that open sources her internal tools, to the committed idealist developing a fair OS.\n\nMost software developers actually want to make the world a better place, even if — or especially when — their ethics don't always align with their company's agenda. The problem, however, is that these values are not always clear and visible from the outside.\n\nIn this article, I explain how Public Badges build on the existing paradigms of Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to help engineers render the implicit values that drive their work explicit. By making values measurable, reproducible, and communicable, Public Badges enable customers, partners, and end users to choose software solutions that align with their own values.\n\n## Test Driven Development\n\n> I just took a DNA test\n> turns out I'm 100% that bitch\n> Even when I'm crying crazy\n\n— Lizzo\n\nRuby was the first programming language that I truly loved. Its emphasis on readability and conceptual clarity is unrivaled even today. A large part of Ruby's appeal to me, though, came from its community's dedication to Test Driven Development.\n\nIt is almost impossible to learn how to program in Ruby without also learning how to write unit tests. The idea behind testing is very simple. For every piece of code that does something, you also write another piece of code that checks that the former functions as intended.\n\nConcretely, a simple unit test would look something like this:\n\n```ruby\nassert_equal( 70, add( 50, 20 ) )\n```\n\nIn this very example, the test asserts that a function called 'add' should be able to come to the conclusion that the sum of 50 and 20 is 70.\n\nTest Driven Development, however, goes one step further than just unit writing tests. The real innovation of the methodology consists in the fact that the tests are not written after that the developer has written the code but before.\n\nThis so-called test first approach radically changes the practice of software development. In this new paradigm, the developer starts her work by making a promise of what the code should do after it is finished. In TDD, tests become contracts. They formalize the expectations that the developer may have of her future work. The practice of TDD as such could therefore already be considered ethical.\n\n## Behavior Driven Development\n\n> Be ready, be ready to get confused\n> There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic\n> To human behavior\n\n— Björk\n\nBehavior Driven Development takes these fundamental ideas of Test Driven Development one step further. In BDD, the focus of the test is no longer the code but the user. It is therefore no longer even called a test but a specification. This is a very, subtle difference, that is often, falsely, dismissed as meaningless.\n\nThe difference is probably best explained after I first show an example:\n\n```gherkin\nFeature: Cash register can correctly add up two amounts\nIn order to make money\nAs a store owner\nI want the cash register to function properly\n\nExample: Adding up two store items\nGiven a customer buys a sweater and a pair of socks\nAnd the sweater costs 50 euro\nAnd the socks cost 20 euro\nWhen I add up 50 euro and 20 euro\nThen the cash register should say 70 euro\n```\n\nFor those who never encountered Gherkin — the so-called domain specific language (DSL) in which this specification is written — before. The above example is actually valid code and not just a story. It can be parsed and executed by a computer.\n\nAs is immediately apparent, BDD specifications are much more verbose than their TDD counterpart. While both tests are functionally equivalent, the gherkin version needs 11 more lines of code. (And that's not even including the implementation part that I omitted here.)\n\nMany developers dismiss these extra lines as superfluous, but thereby miss the essential point of BDD. Tests are no longer exclusively intended for developers. They are meant to facilitate the dialogue between the engineer and the software's intended user and/or customer. BDD specifications are a tool to manage their mutual expectations.\n\nOne could argue that, from a BDD perspective, the most important line in the specification above is thus the following:\n\n```gherkin\nAs a store owner\n```\n\nAs opposed to TDD tests, BDD specifications don't formalize the expectations between developers (either other engineers or the infamous future selves). They create a contract between developers and the software's future users.\n\n## Value Driven Development\n\n> I'm just valuin' the value\n\n— Lil' Wayne\n\nBDD constantly reminds the developer of the fact that there is an actual user of her software, which — as anyone who has ever used a computer knows — is already a feat as such.\n\nBut while the user centricity of BDD has been often praised, there is another line in the example above that unfortunately has never gotten the attention that it deserves:\n\n```gherkin\nIn order to make money\n```\n\nThis is the line in the test where the actual value of the software is determined. This example is deliberately a bit contrived to make a point. While negotiating and formalizing their mutual expectations, users and developers should decide which values they value. And while making money is definitely an important one. It is far from the only one value that they could and should choose.\n\nJust imagine what else we could have stated as the project's goal:\n\n```gherkin\nIn order to increase accessibility\n```\n\n```gherkin\nIn order to make people happier\n```\n\n```gherkin\nIn order to protect people's privacy\n```\n\nAnd just imagine how their respective specifications could have looked if we would have chosen these different values?\n\nThat's exactly what we are doing with Public Badges. Encouraging developers to write software specifications with values in mind. The badge itself is in the end merely an insignia of merit. A token that shows to the outside world that its creators actually committed themselves to this practice of making their ethics measurable, reproducible, and communicable: Value Driven Development.\n\n---\n\nThis is the second in a series of articles.

Picture a future where our educational systems are transformed to be inclusive and empowering for all, where our environmental practices not only preserve but also rejuvenate the natural world, and where social and economic inequalities are addressed through creative and equitable solutions. Envision communities thriving through sustainable development, interconnected by shared knowledge and resources, and driven by a collective spirit of innovation that prioritizes the well-being of all inhabitants and the only planet that we know to be inhabitable.\n\nThis is the promise of ecosystem architecture, a forward-thinking, ecclectic, and effective practice that blends the power of decentralized systems with the principles of regenerative design. As we navigate some of the most complex and pressing challenges in history, we should grasp the opportunity and rethink the frameworks that got us into trouble in the first place. We need to find new ways to build and sustain our communities, thereby turning the fragmented remnants of our digital age into fertile ground for a more resilient and harmonious future. In this article, I will explore how decentralization and regeneration converge to offer solutions that are not only sustainable but transformative, fostering ecosystems that thrive on renewal and interconnectedness.\n\n> We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims.\n\n— [Buckminster Fuller](https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/)\n\nDecentralization has undeniably been the motor of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century technology economy. The rise of many Asian countries to economic powerhouses would not have happened if the US and Europe had not displaced their manufacturing overseas. The contemporary internet economy fully depends on the global open source movement delivering high-quality software. While globalization and decentralization are technically not the same, the former inevitably creates the need for the latter. When economic, political, and cultural activities are dispersed over time and space, new modes of control and coordination become necessary.\n\nIn her seminal work _Atlas of AI_ (2021), Kate Crawford demonstrates that mining and extraction have been the tech economy's Pavlovian reaction to these needs. From the 10x mindset of venture capital, the dehumanizing crunches of the game industry, to the e-waste burial lakes of Baotou, so-called innovation often comes at the expense of nature, people, and often both. Value is produced by disposing of more than is kept. And now that we have almost completely exploited our own planet, outer space has become the next frontier.\n\n> Extreme wealth and power generated from technology companies now enables a small group of men to pursue their own private space race. They depend on exploiting the knowledge and infrastructures of the public space programs of the twentieth century and often rely on government funding an tax incentives as well. Their aim is not to limit extraction and growth, but to extend it across the solar system.\n\n— [Kate Crawford](https://x.com/katecrawford?lang=en)\n\nThinkers have pointed out that waste generation and accumulation have been the shadow side of modern distributed modes of production since their inception. From the early Frankfurt School and the Club of Rome to the current climate movement, the drive for innovation has often been equated with an excess mindset. Ironically, this may be one of the few things that both eco-warriors and venture capitalists fully agree on: to innovate, you need to produce large quantities of waste.\n\nHowever, I believe both sides have been looking at it the wrong way. Innovation is not a quality of the technological artifact but rather of the practice that produces it.\n\nTrue innovation is a practice involving continuous ideation, experimentation, and refinement, adapting to changing circumstances and needs. It is not just about creating new products or technologies but about fostering a culture of creativity and problem-solving that permeates every aspect of an organization or community. By focusing on the practice of innovation, we emphasize collaboration, adaptability, and resilience, ensuring that the solutions we develop are sustainable, equitable, and capable of addressing complex, interconnected challenges.\n\n> Practices create paths where there were none\n\n— [Michel de Certeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life)\n\nIt is in this practical notion of innovation that decentralized and regenerative design meet. Regeneration goes beyond sustainability by not only aiming to restore, but also to renew and revitalize systems and communities. Whereas sustainable design aims for damage control by mitigating harm, regenerative design seeks to make ecosystems healthier and more vibrant than ever before. From the perspective of regeneration, waste becomes the seeds of a promising future rather than the remnants of a paradise lost. Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, rather than perfection and wholeness, are key to a better future. Ecosystem architecture thus embraces these and related practices wholeheartedly.\n","metadata":{"title":"Practice Innovation","slug":"practice-innovation","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-07-29T12:45:35.886Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":2},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349261,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Practice Innovation","rootJobId":"itXNCPofo9sq"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787716,1765728787716,,

Then we spend our days in meetings about meetings. The future\n  of work is play—not because work should be easy, but because it should be\n  voluntary, creative, and aligned with who you actually are.\nauthor: Yeehaa\n---\nWe tell our children to find work that matters, to be creative, to follow their passion. Then we spend our days in meetings about meetings, defending positions we do not believe in, waiting for permission to do work that could start today.\n\nInside, the questions multiply: Why am I burning out on a purpose I am not even aligned with? Why fear AI taking work I never wanted to do in the first place? Why save money for someday while current life passes by? Why wait for permission to start work that actually matters?\n\nThis is the quietly loud crisis of talent waste. These contradictions are not just individual struggles. They reveal fundamental breakdowns in how we organize work, life, and collective action, creating three interconnected traps:\n\n**Work itself has become alienated from purpose.** We schedule meetings to avoid decisive action, mistake process for progress, and perform busyness instead of creating meaningful impact. We cling to collaboration rituals that replace genuine connection, defend positions that provide paychecks but no fulfillment, and protect roles that sustain us financially but starve us spiritually.\n\n**Life design remains constrained by a factory mindset.** We anchor salaries to zip codes rather than value created, force biological rhythms into arbitrary time blocks, and require permission for meaningful work that could begin immediately.\n\n**Collective change remains trapped by self-defeating patterns.** We complain about broken systems while expecting others to pioneer change, network with people we don't respect in industries we want to escape, and attempt individual solutions to collective problems while choosing comfort over the growth that could actually transform our circumstances.\n\nThe deeper issue becomes clear: we are using industrial-era frameworks to organize post-industrial lives. This is not personal failure. It is systemic misalignment.\n\nThe true solution does not lie in better work-life balance or more flexible schedules. It starts with recognizing that the most meaningful human activities have always felt more like play than work. When we create value and grow naturally, we do not mind putting in the overtime.\n\n## Work It, Flip It, and Reverse It\n\nTraditional institutions — corporations, universities, geographic communities — were designed for industrial-era standardization. They created workers who would show up, follow orders, and optimize for metrics that served capital rather than human flourishing.\n\nThis model is collapsing under its own contradictions. Burnout rates, talent shortages, and mass resignations signal that people are rejecting work that feels meaningless. Meanwhile, the most valuable work — innovation, problem-solving, creative collaboration — happens precisely when people are intrinsically motivated rather than externally controlled.\n\nWhen we say _the future of work is play,_ we do not mean ping-pong tables, mandatory karaoke, or casual Fridays. We mean fundamental restructuring of how humans collaborate.\n\nPlay means:\n\n- Voluntary engagement where you lose track of time\n- Creating your own rules and boundaries\n- The freedom to fail without catastrophe\n- The merger of learning and doing\n\nPlay is work designed around human nature rather than against it. It is what children do naturally before we teach them to color within the lines, ask for permission to cross them, to postpone their satisfaction until it is their turn. Play is what we do before we are taught to separate work from life.\n\n## Bring It Back, Bring It Back\n\nFor the first time, we can organize work this way again. We are seeing the early stages of systems that let people coordinate effectively outside traditional institutions while keeping their autonomy. This is not remote work or gig platforms. It is building entirely new social and economic structures.\n\nThe key technologies to build such decentralized work ecosystems already exist: AI handles the busywork that once required human attention, freeing creative energy for meaningful challenges. Remote collaboration dissolves the geographic constraints that forced us into commuting patterns and office hierarchies. Creator platforms enable direct value exchange between people who make things and people who want them, bypassing institutional middlemen. Blockchain creates trust systems that do not require traditional gatekeepers to verify transactions or enforce agreements.\n\nTogether, they enable us to build on four principles that flip industrial assumptions:\n\n**Technology as Infrastructure, Not Product**: Building alternative systems rather than optimizing broken ones.\n\n**Collective Coordination Without Control**: Groups coordinating at scale without surrendering autonomy to hierarchies.\n\n**Ownership Over Employment**: Participants owning stakes in what they help create rather than selling labor to capital owners.\n\n**Values-Based Network Formation**: People finding others who share their vision for how work should feel, unconstrained by geography or institutions.\n\n## Stakes Is High\n\nAI is not taking jobs. It is bluntly exposing how much human talent we have been wasting. When machines can do the busywork, what remains is the deeply human: creativity, connection, meaning-making. The very things our current system crushes.\n\nThe opportunity cost is far more than just money. It is the version of yourself that dies a little each day you choose safety over growth. It is showing our children that we do not actually believe what we tell them: that passion is for weekends, not Wednesdays. that dreams are advice we give, not lives we live.\n\nAt Rizom, we are building one implementation of this future. The infrastructure for professional collaboration where work becomes play through shared interests and values, where geography no longer determines compensation, where participants become owners with equity stakes.\n\nBut this is bigger than any single platform. It is about recognizing that when millions experience the same frustration, the solution is not individual optimization. It is building solid foundations that enable collective transformation.\n\n## The Choice Is Yours\n\nStop asking why the current system does not work and start investing in alternatives that could.\n\nThe infrastructure is emerging. The tools exist. The communities are forming. Your choice is whether to help shape this future or wait for others to build it.\n\nThe future of work is play. Not because work should be easy, but because it should be voluntary, creative, and aligned with who you actually are.\n\nThe same values we teach our children? Stop postponing them past retirement. It is time to live them now.\n\nAre you ready to play with us?\n","metadata":{"title":"The Future of Work is Play","slug":"the-future-of-work-is-play","status":"published","publishedAt":"2025-10-15T09:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764605536835,"updated":1764605536836,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"The Future of Work is Play","rootJobId":"wobBhTQPXH84"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787717,1765728787717,,

This move hardly ever results in the intended result, and almost\n  always weakens the trust relations between digital citizens. With Public\n  Badges, we enable organizations and initiatives to communicate why they are\n  trustworthy to their users.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Public Badges\nseriesIndex: 1\n---\n> We can't go on together\n> With suspicious minds\n\n— Elvis Presley\n\nFinding examples of failed trust relations has never been difficult, but today it's actually quite a challenge to miss them. Governments don't trust their citizens to stay inside, while citizens don't believe that their governments are acting in their best interest. Strangers are vessels for deadly viruses, and viruses are dangerous weapons developed by foreign governments or Dr. Frankensteins. In fact, the contemporary global political landscape closely resembles a Mexican Standoff.\n\nMeanwhile on the internet, things are not looking very bright either. Consumers are constantly forced to accept a Faustian tradeoff: either hand over your personal data or give up your social life. Finding a trustworthy source of information has become next to impossible. Knowledge is considered an entertaining conversation starter, but does not hold any weight as such. One man's facts is another's fake news.\n\nAmidst all these suspicious minds, however, I am optimistic that we can rebuild trust relations in the public realm: both online and offline. Public Badges are a modest attempt to provide building blocks that enable organizations and initiatives to communicate their values with their users. To build trust relations built on evidence, not just anecdotes.\n\n## The Paradox of Security\n\n> Why can't you see\n> What you're doing to me\n> When you don't believe a word I say?\n\n— Elvis Presley\n\nAs my teacher Friedrich Kittler posed, Code was originally developed to establish secure communication against a backdrop of suspicion. Its invention dates back to the Roman Empire. Foot soldiers were ordered to carry encrypted messages — that they could not decipher themselves — between higher officers that were entrusted with secret key. They thereby actively performed the paradox that holds the internet hostage today: a secure network of communication comes at the expense of trust.\n\nLooking back at the history of the internet, it is easy to see that we invested a lot in making our technology secure, but not nearly as much in making it trustworthy. Security measures alone, however, never made our digital spaces any less dangerous. Most attempts to create safe digital public spaces based on security alone failed or even backfired. At the same time, the actual solution was often found by looking in exactly the opposite direction: building networks of trust.\n\nIn order to illustrate this, I'll walk you through a relatively recent example: the history of spam filtering. Up until the mid 1990's, little to nothing was done to prevent the unwanted soliciting on the internet. However, the rising importance of digital communication combined with the overwhelming increase of unwanted emails created a demand for spam filters. The first attempts all revolved around blocking suspicious domain and filtering for unwanted emails. These measures, however, weren't very effective. Spammers soon discovered techniques like domain and identity spoofing that made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between email and spam.\n\nThe big breakthrough came during the mid 2000's when ISPs shifted to so-called reputation lists, something that was complemented with engagement metrics over the last decade. Instead of just building blacklists, ISPs started sharing their whitelist and other positive metrics with another. Turns out, it's much more effective to build networks of trusted partners than to police the offenders. (The history of anti-virus software by the way is remarkably similar.)\n\n## Invest in Trust\n\n> And we can't build our dreams\n> On suspicious minds\n\n— Elvis Presley\n\nIn order to make the internet more safe, we have to invest in building networks of trust. In order to achieve this, technology alone can never be the answer. As the history of spam filtering shows, coalitions of actual people and organizations are an excellent medicine against the side-effects of algorithms. But technology can be part of the solution. And technology needs to be. Because even more dangerous than letting trust be a purely algorithmic consideration, is leaving it entirely anecdotal. \"I know him, he's a good guy\", is a statement that was invalidated for once and for all by: \"Don't be evil.\"\n\nThe safety of our Public Spaces needs to be evidence based. With Public Badges, we enable organizations to collect and communicate the evidence around the values that they consider valuable. In future posts, I'll write more about the exact mechanisms that we are developing to facilitate these processes. For now, however, I want to conclude by saying this: sustainable safety cannot be built upon security. Let's invest in trust instead.\n\n---\n\nPublic Badges is an initiative of Public Spaces that is currently being developed by Waag and Offcourse Studio.\n","metadata":{"title":"Fundamentals of Trust","slug":"fundamentals-of-trust","status":"published","publishedAt":"2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","seriesName":"Public Badges","seriesIndex":1},"created":1764051528713,"updated":1764265438955,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Fundamentals of Trust","rootJobId":"vL471SKhD5Qq"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787719,1765728787719,,

But\n  these terms designate much more than a mere technical distinction. This post\n  explains that unsupervised learning promises a new way to think about\n  intelligence in general: Human and otherwise.\nauthor: Yeehaa\n---\n> Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles\n\n— Brockhampton\n\nWhile the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an entire century before Edison's device was released from His Master's Voice. Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the pipe dream of High Fidelity, that they completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the gramophone also offered.\n\nOnce Pandora was out of the box — and no, it weren't John, Paul, George & Ringo that released her — music would never be the same again. Sound engineers projected the recording arts beyond the spatial and temporal boundaries of reality. Or, to put it in the lingo of Sun Ra, Music was no longer earth-bound; space became the place.\n\nIt is high time to free the discourse of Artificial Intelligence from its shackles of fidelity too. Technically, the field has been ready to do so for quite a while. Unsupervised Machine Learning is the branch of machine learning that does not need a human baseline to improve its findings, but rather recognizes patterns that are beyond the scope of human cognition and categorization.\n\nStubborn creatures as they are, however, humans are often reluctant to accept that their intelligence is surpassed by their own creation. Instead, they rather hold on to their primitive and biased opinions and observations. This post argues that this should change.\n\n## Toe the Line\n\n> Yo, Dre!\n> Give me a funky-ass bassline!\n> Right here!\n\n— Eazy-E\n\nSupervised learning is the most commonly used branch of machine learning. The supervision in its name, designates the practice of developing a human baseline. This baseline is operationalized in the feedback loop between the training data and loss function. For those not familiar with this process and these terms, I'll briefly explain it.\n\nLike most unborns, a machine learning model knows nothing about the world at its inception. To improve, it needs to be taught right from wrong, or at least better from worse. And who better to teach her than its creator? Right?\n\nIn order to train a model, programmers feed a model a set of problems with known answers (labels). These answers, however, are hidden to the model. At the end of each learning cycle (epoch) the answers that the algorithm comes up with are compared to the actual answers, and the difference in accuracy (or a similar metric) is measured.\n\nThe established baseline is the alpha and omega of supervised learning. The computer will never come up with answers that it has not been taught. But what happens if we were to take the human baseline out of the loop? This process is called: unsupervised learning. In the remainder, I'll only focus clustering — a specific application of unsupervised learning — but the underlying principles hold for other techniques too.\n\n## Low-Fidelity\n\n> Take the bass line out\n\n— Jay-Z\n\nUnsupervised learning is amoral: there is no right and wrong. In fact, there is not even a clearly defined set of problems or questions; just data points. These data points are converted to vectors, which for the course of this explanation, are best thought of as coordinates. An unsupervised learning algorithm simply measures the distance between the coordinates before it groups them in clusters on the basis of their proximity to each other.\n\nThe classic use-case for this form of unsupervised learning is in marketing. Where marketeers used to work with user personae, imaginary models of how their different customers look like and behave. Machine learning turned this process upside down. Instead of defining the models upfront, it discovers clusters of customers that are present in the data. While this was bad news for the story tellers amongst the marketeers, this cluster based targeting turned out to be much more effective... although occasional happy accidents do occur, of course.\n\nIn marketing, the benefits of unsupervised learning are easy to sell. Simply because the human baseline is of less importance than another measurable goal: the bottom line. In other domains, we are often less inclined to believe that computers can come up with better conclusions than us.\n\nJust imagine the following:\n\n- The music of Johan Sebastian Bach has more similarities to that of Justin Bieber than to that of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n- The most effective way to solve the climate crisis is the global redistribution of wealth\n- President Trump only tweets proven facts\n- The earth is in fact flat\n\nThese findings are, of course, made up — although I believe at least one of them to be true. They are here to illustrate the following point: are we willing to accept the superiority of an algorithm when its conclusions are counter to our own observations, opinions or beliefs? In other words, are we capable of dropping the human baseline? Lower our voice to make room for better ones?\n\nWe should!\n\nMachine Learning does not need to repeat and hollow out human intelligence. It should be used to explore new and better ways to be intelligent. The only thing it needs to unleash its full potential is our permission to drop the baseline.\n","metadata":{"title":"Intelligence Unleashed","slug":"intelligence-unleashed","status":"published","publishedAt":"2020-04-09T00:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764051601601,"updated":1764265438960,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Intelligence Unleashed","rootJobId":"MLZkRUvCoBUS"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787720,1765728787720,,

This article explores how this\n  peer-to-peer manufacturing model surpasses both traditional innovation and\n  Western open source, while confronting its environmental costs.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 6\n---\nIn the realm of technology and innovation, decentralization has emerged as a powerful force shaping the way we create, collaborate, and distribute power. Despite what crypto-boys want us to believe, blockchain, bitcoin, and DAOs are far from the first, let alone the best, manifestations of decentralization. The feudal system, the silk road, and the Greek city states were all built around principles of distributed power and organization.\n\nHam (or amateur) radio is often hailed as the prime example of decentralization. This communication medium, rooted in the early 20th century, enabled direct peer-to-peer interactions without reliance on centralized infrastructures, while its community embodied a spirit of experimentation, self-reliance, and collaboration. Up until the current day, ham operators contribute to a network that spans the globe. Resilience is inherent in ham radio, which is demonstrated by its adaptability to technological challenges and its capacity to maintain communication in times of crisis. Ham radio thereby laid the groundwork for all decentralized communities to come.\n\nOver the last few decades, an even superior model of decentralization has started to appear in and around Shenzhen. The so-called shanzhai — literally: mountain stronghold, slang: to copy or parody — known for their unconventional and sometimes flamboyant innovations, have become the avantgarde of technological ingenuity and agility. This ecosystem of smaller manufacturers in China has repeatedly defied conventional norms, producing an array of unique and unexpected devices. From modified but practical versions of popular gadgets (the dual-sim smartphone) to entirely novel creations (a smartphone that look like a pack of Marlboros), the shanzhai are characterized by a daring spirit of experimentation and a rapid pace of innovation. Showcasing the ecosystem's ability to quickly adapt to changing consumer demands and technological trends.\n\nInitially seen as a gang of shameless copycats, it is through the pioneering work of Andrew 'bunnie' Huang that a more generous and accurate view on the shanzhai has arisen. His book _The Hardware Hacker_ (2017) is exceptional because his analysis of the Shenzhen ecosystem is free from any preconceived (i.e. Western) notions of innovation and creativity. By doing this, he comes to a vision of the shanzhai's full, future potential.\n\n> I have a theory that when the amount of knowledge and the scale of the markets in Shenzhen reach critical mass, the Chinese will stop being simply workers or copiers. They'll take control of their destinies and ultimately, become innovation leaders. These stories about the shanzhai and their mashups are just the tip of an iceberg with the potential to change the way business is done — perhaps not in the United States, but certainly in that massive, untapped market often referred to as 'the rest of the world.'\n\n—Andrew 'bunnie' Huang\n\nTo bunnie, the shanzai's true innovation does not lie in the electronics that they produce. It is the model of production that is the real game changer. Their principles are evolved versions of those seen in the ham radio decentralization model.\n\n**Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**: Like ham radio, the shanzhai embrace a peer-to-peer approach to collaboration. However, while the amateur radio community focuses on communication protocols and technologies, the shanzhai extend this concept to the entire electronics manufacturing process. Their decentralized network involves a multitude of actors, ranging from manufacturers and designers to innovator. Collectively this diverse ecosystem contributes to the creation of a plethora of electronic products, marking a clear departure from the more specific focus of ham radio and its rather homogenous community.\n\n**Rapid Iterative Innovation**: The shanzhai's emphasis on rapid iteration and adaptation in the competitive electronics market represents an evolution from the ham radio model. Among the shanzhai, speed of innovation and adaptation is essential for staying competitive, surpassing the traditional and more leisurely pace often associated with ham radio experimentation.\n\n**Market Resilience**: the shanzhai exemplify a remarkable level of resilience within the Chinese industry. This resilience is multifaceted, extending beyond technical challenges to address broader economic and societal considerations. In the face of market challenges, supply chain disruptions, and rapidly changing consumer preferences, the shanzhai model has demonstrated an ability to swiftly adapt and innovate. The decentralized nature of the shanzhai empowers the industry to respond dynamically to external pressures.\n\n**Civil Resilience**: Furthermore, its model also leads to an increase in civil resilience by contributing to economic diversification and empowering local communities. The model's adaptability and ability to navigate complexities in the global electronics market underscore its significance not only as an innovative manufacturing approach but also as a contributor to broader societal resilience.\n\n**Ecosystem-sourced Development**: Central to the Shanzhai approach is the fact that manufacturers share intricate blueprints that outline the design and structure of electronic devices, along with bills of materials specifying required components and their sources. This shared information cultivates a dynamic and expansive collaborative environment within the Shanzhai ecosystem. Shanzhai's progressive view on intellectual property further distinguishes its approach, allowing for a more open and flexible innovation ecosystem where ideas and designs are freely shared. In _The Hardware Hacker_, this practice is refered to as gongkai.\n\n> The West has a 'broadcast' view of IP and ownership: good ideas and innovation are credited to a clearly specified set of authors or inventors, and society pays them a royalty for their initiatives and good works. China has a 'network' view of IP and ownership: one attains the far-reaching sight necessary to create good ideas and innovations by standing on the shoulders of others, and people trade these ideas as favors.\n\n— Andrew 'bunnie' Huang\n\nIn bunnie's eyes, gongkai (meaning: open or to make public) also challenges that other dominant, contemporary, Western mode of decentralized production: open source. He claims that this model is much more suited for open hardware than its Western counterpart. Without Gongkai, hardware hackers are to either doomed use old-dated and more expensive components, or they have to resort to reverse engineering.\n\nThrough gongkai, an innovative decentralized practice, the shanzhai have created a vibrant ecosystem that is capable of iterating and innovating at an incredible speed, while at the same time being more resilient than most other ecosystems. However, the accelerated pace of production and the constant evolution of electronic devices within the Shenzhen ecosystem comes at a cost. And in the case of the shanzhai it is predominantly nature that pays the price. Its practices of rapid iterations do not only result in innovation, but also in tons and tons of waste. The disposability of outdated components, prototypes, and devices forms the shadow side of the Shenzhen manufacturing landscape.\n\nThe environmental impact of the shanzhai model is multifaceted and profound. The rapid iteration cycle, while driving innovation, leads to an accelerated turnover of electronic products. This results in a significant increase in electronic waste (e-waste), a growing global concern. The informal nature of many shanzhai operations often means that proper e-waste management protocols are not consistently followed, leading to improper disposal of hazardous materials contained in electronic components.\n\nFurthermore, the shanzhai model's emphasis on speed and cost-effectiveness can sometimes come at the expense of environmental considerations in the manufacturing process. The use of cheaper, less environmentally friendly materials and production methods can lead to increased pollution and resource depletion. The decentralized nature of the shanzhai ecosystem, while beneficial for innovation, can make it challenging to implement and enforce stringent environmental standards across the board.\n\nThe environmental footprint extends beyond waste generation. The energy-intensive nature of electronics manufacturing, coupled with China's heavy reliance on coal-powered electricity, means that the carbon footprint of shanzhai production is substantial. The rapid prototyping and small-batch production runs characteristic of the Shanzhai model can be less energy-efficient than larger, more optimized production processes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the shanzhai model also holds potential for positive environmental impact. Its emphasis on resourcefulness and adaptability could be leveraged to drive eco-innovation. Some Shanzhai manufacturers have begun exploring more sustainable practices, such as using recycled materials or developing products specifically designed for easier recycling or longer lifespans. The model's inherent flexibility could allow for quicker adoption of green technologies and practices compared to more rigid, traditional manufacturing systems.\n\nWhile the shanzhai breaks with the Silicon Valley model of innovation and IP, they still share its mindset of exponential growth and excess. If the gongkai model will shape the future technological landscape, it becomes imperative to balance its innovative strengths with environmental considerations, fostering a regenerative perspective on value creation and waste production.\n","metadata":{"title":"Shenzhen Goes Ham","slug":"shenzhen-goes-ham","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-09-09T08:08:53.809Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":6},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349276,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Shenzen Goes Ham","rootJobId":"ewlkKgvqLzuk"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787721,1765728787721,,

I rediscovered this short text in a far corner of the internet today. It's the manifesto for the Data Drive research group that Sander van Maas, Robin Boast, and I started together in 2013 at the University of Amsterdam. Forgot all about it, but boy, is it relevant today._\n\nIn 'The Age of the World Picture' (1938), Martin Heidegger argues that modern science and technology rest in their entirety on computation. Importantly, he warns that these ever-growing numbers and increasingly complex calculations come with an uncontrollable, and all-encompassing shadow. According to Heidegger, however, this shadow does not only designate a loss of control, it also announces the coming of a new era:\n\n> \"Everyday opinion sees in the shadow only the lack of light, if not light's complete denial. In truth, however, the shadow is a manifest, though impenetrable, testimony emitting of light...\"\n\nIn 2009, Chris Anderson makes his own eschatological prediction in Wired Magazine, when he declares \"The End of Science\". Like Heidegger before him, Anderson's apocalypse rests on large numbers and complex computation, now called big data. As opposed to Heidegger, Anderson does not recognize a shadow in the 'age of the terabytes.' To him, data do not conceal the world but provide direct and unmediated knowledge of it. Science is again in the position to deal with reality — given with the data — rather than with theories and models about reality.\n\nIn digital humanities, data often serve to ground the same disciplinary, conceptual and methodological frameworks that were in place before the advent of the digital. Rather than proclaiming the End of Science some active in this new field envisage a serial reaffirmation of its humanist heritage. In addition, by conceiving of new technological research possibilities in terms of new tools replacing old ones and by focusing on pattern identities, digital humanities seem to reaffirm a logic of the Same. They tend to neglect the creative, driving power that (big) data can have if seen from the vantage point of difference.\n\nThis research group works from the premise that these returns to realism and humanism are far from being exhaustive. As an alternative, we aim to reintroduce Heidegger's notion of the gigantic ('that through which the quantitative becomes a special quality') into the debates around the future of science. Rather than as a threat we see data's shadow as an opportunity. Whereas Heidegger conceives a practice of contemplation as the only viable answer to uncontrollable computation, we recognize a chance for the humanities towards actionable knowledge.\n\nAs Friedrich Kittler argues in 'On The Take-Off Of Operators' (1990), computer technology has rendered the opposition between thinking and action invalid. Contemplation cannot provide an answer to the problems that data pose to contemporary scientific research and education.\n\nMoving beyond predefined genres and media such as literature, music, or film, data are now driving knowledge production, representation, and manipulation. Inviting speakers from academic, artistic, and commercial contexts we as a research group aim to address the following questions concerning digital information and knowledge technologies and the ways in which these technologies inform our commerce with data:\n\n- Who are the agents of big data?\n- If the humanities are moving away from interpretation, where are they heading to? Which verbs express (or for that matter, transform) the current relation between science and data?\n- How can commercial uses of datasets inform academic research?\n- How can academic research be tested and validated in conjunction with commercial ventures?\n","metadata":{"title":"Data Drive","slug":"data-drive","status":"published","publishedAt":"2020-05-15T00:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764051448461,"updated":1764265438963,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Data Drive","rootJobId":"yIvxglqXjniU"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787724,1765728787724,,

This article\n  explores how Wahl's regenerative culture principles challenge Darwinian\n  competition with natural systems optimizing for collective health through\n  alignment.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 8\n---\nWhen perceived through the lens of abundance, decentralized ecosystems have the potential to be more vibrant and resilient than any centralized community or organization can ever be. By giving communities more control over their resources and decision-making processes, they become increasingly empowered to collaboratively create healthier ecosystems. It is exactly in this north star vision where the practices of decentralization and regeneration meet.\n\n> Design for resilient and regenerative cultures is about facilitating positive emergence, co-creating collaborative networks of relationships that nurture the conditions in which we (life) can meet uncertainty with creativity, adaptive capacity and a readiness to transform in response to change and disruption.\n\n— Daniel Christian Wahl\n\nRegeneration is an approach to designing systems. Its applications are wide-ranging: from physical spaces such as natural ecosystems, towns, and buildings to more abstract ones like communities, initiatives, and ventures. What defines this practice in all these different contexts is the underlying goal: the designed spaces should improve the environment and society that they interact with in a sustainable way. In order to accomplish this goal, regenerative design employs a plethora of cultural techniques. For current purposes I will only zoom in on the following two:\n\n**Permaculture**: This concept, coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, is a portmanteau combining permanent and (agri)culture. Permaculture is a conscious and considerate approach to work with nature rather than against it. By emphasizing the thoughtful use of resources such as water, energy, and materials, permaculture intentionally fosters a diverse range of plants, animals, and microorganisms within a given ecosystem.\n\n**Biomimicry**: The practice of replicating the processes, forms, and strategies found in the natural world. This idea was popularized by biologist and author Janine Benyus who, in her book titled _Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature_ (1997), explores how nature's designs, processes, and systems can serve as inspiration for human innovation across various fields, including design, engineering, and technology.\n\nWhile different in scope, activity, and outcomes, permaculture and biomimicry share a deep desire to learn from nature. Whereas modern natural sciences are aimed at predicting, controlling, and exploiting the biosphere, these contemporary regenerative alternatives try to avoid such hierarchical power relations. Their stance towards nature is better understood as a dialogue: they listen and talk to it. This conversation does not limit itself to nature in the strict sense of the word: it extends to culture, the past, and ultimately the entire universe. That makes regeneration first and foremost a practice of alignment.\n\nBut in order to align, one first has to learn to truly listen. In _Designing Regenerative Cultures_ (2016), Daniel Christian Wahl asks the question: what can we learn from natural ecosystems? His surprising answer is: collaboration. Classic darwinism with its emphasis on competition and scarcity has lead to a complete misrepresentation of how nature works. Modern biology, Wahl claims, has unveiled that ecosystems works towards optimal health for the whole.\n\n> All our actions affect the sustainability, resilience and health of the communities in which we live, work and learn. The relationships we create and the collective vision of the future we create with our communities will shape whether they are sustainable and capable of regeneration. The community level is where we can all contribute to the emergence of a regenerative culture. The nested networks of interactions we co-create shape the present and future of our community and its participation in local ecosystems.\n\n— Daniel Christian Wahl\n\nCollaboration is not an ethical imperative but rather a natural fact. Competition exists, of course, but mainly as a short time measure. It is an intervention that corrects imbalances or stagnation. Over longer periods, the participants in thriving ecosystems develop ways to collaborate without a central instance of control. Through continuous alignment, they organically work towards an optimal configuration for the entire system. The achieved optimum, however, is never permanent and never perfect.\n\nEcosystem architecture challenges us to reconsider our relationship with the natural world and with each other. Instead of seeking to control or exploit our environment, we are invited to engage in a dialogue with nature, listening carefully to its intricate patterns and processes. This approach not only fosters more sustainable practices but also nurtures a deeper connection between human communities and the ecosystems — either natural or human — that they inhabit. By adopting ecosystem architecture principles, we can create systems that are not only sustainable but also adaptive and self-renewing.\n\nThe emphasis on collaboration over competition in natural systems provides a powerful model for human societies and serves as a key principle in ecosystem architecture. By recognizing that our actions are intricately connected to the health of our communities and local ecosystems, we can begin to design systems that prioritize the well-being of the whole rather than short-term individual gains. This holistic approach has the potential to create more vibrant, resilient, and adaptive communities capable of thriving in the face of uncertainty and change.\n\nAs we move forward, the challenge lies in translating these ecosystem architecture principles into practical applications across various domains - from urban planning and architecture to economic systems and social structures. This might involve designing cities that function like forests, creating circular economies that eliminate waste, or developing governance systems that adapt and evolve like living organisms. By embracing the wisdom of regenerative design and ecosystem architecture, we open ourselves to a future where human innovation aligns harmoniously with nature's rhythms, fostering a world that is not just sustainable, but truly flourishing.\n\nThe journey towards regenerative cultures and ecosystem-inspired architectures is ongoing and ever-evolving. It requires continuous learning, adaptation, and a willingness to reimagine our role within the broader tapestry of life. As we embark on this path, we may find that by nurturing the health of our ecosystems and communities through thoughtful ecosystem architecture, we are simultaneously nurturing our own capacity for growth, resilience, and transformation. This approach offers a promising pathway to address complex global challenges and create a more harmonious relationship between human systems and the natural world.\n","metadata":{"title":"Learning From Nature","slug":"learning-from-nature","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-09-25T08:29:24.280Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":8},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349285,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Learning From Nature","rootJobId":"4fE4di1qGTE2"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787726,1765728787726,,

This article examines how Borawake's Garb-Age\n  practice reframes garbage as intrinsic to nature and culture, offering a\n  paradigm shift from extraction to regeneration.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 7\n---\nDecentralization should not be confused with fragmentation. When implemented thoughtfully, decentralization's cultural techniques can actually mitigate the negative effects of fragmentation. However, the most prominent contemporary manifestation of decentralization has fallen prey to an excess mindset. The initial excitement surrounding blockchain's potential as an immutable and incorruptible ledger has been overshadowed by cryptocurrency's promise of instant wealth—a notion that often resembles a pyramid scheme.\n\nCritics might argue that decentralization inherently leads to fragmentation, citing examples like the proliferation of incompatible blockchain networks or the balkanization of online communities. However, this view overlooks the potential for decentralized systems to create new forms of connection and collaboration. For instance, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) demonstrate how dispersed individuals can work towards common goals without centralized control.\n\nRather than being the pinnacle of decentralization, crypto is better understood as a short resurgence of a mirage that had kept the end of the last millennium under its spell. The 1990's held a sincere belief that capitalism and liberalism had solved all problems and history was close to its completion. Excess, and its antipode scarcity, played a central role in that narrative. Cold fusion was going to provide us with an inexhaustible source of energy, and the internet opened up a new virtual space that revolved around a boundless resource: information. And in such a world without limits, universal peace was obviously just around the corner.\n\nThen the dotcom bubble burst, the twin towers were destroyed, and the inconvenient truth of climate change became slowly apparent.\n\nThe narrative of limitless progress, however, slowly resurfaced in the last few decades. But while capitalism, in its various forms, definitely did little to nothing to question it, the excess mindset cannot be entirely reduced to it either. Indeed, even as capitalism has evolved into diverse models - from stakeholder capitalism to conscious capitalism and beyond - the underlying premise of scarcity as an organizing principle has remained largely unchallenged. As Walter Benjamin most poignantly pointed out in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935), the technical affordances of an era define its ideological affordances just as much as vice versa. If modern capitalism, in all its manifestations, depends on extraction and waste generation, it is only because it relies on means of production that facilitate it.\n\n> The field of attention shifts to the person who provides the apparatus. The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.\n\n— Walter Benjamin\n\nBenjamin frames modernity as the process that eliminates physical and temporal scarcity as the limiting factor of humanity's material progress. For example, cameras — even analogue ones — can capture a portrait in the same amount of time that it takes a painter to blink his eyes. And while his painting is unique, the camera's snapshot can be reproduced infinitely. Technical innovation was already determined by the 10x mindset centuries long before the San Francisco valley decided to cut down its orange orchards and become silicon.\n\nThe discovery of a truly inexhaustible resource is not only capitalism's holy grail of capitalism, it is also its achilles heel. Since scarcity is the ideology's organizing principle, finding a resource that never runs out would paradoxically mean its own demise. It is thus not a coincidence that at the same time as Benjamin examined how the world would (stop to) function without scarcity, his close friend and accomplice Georges Bataille started exploring how an economy of excess would look like in his early essay _The Notion of Expenditure_. A theme that would define his entire oeuvre.\n\nLike the venture capitalist of today, Bataille encourages activities that may seem wasteful or irrational within traditional economic frameworks. History teaches that it demands significant risks to reap innovative and potentially disruptive ideas. However, where the venture capitalist only focuses on the outliers and disposes the rest, Bataille does the exact opposite and chooses to embrace _The Accursed Share_ (1949).\n\n> Expenditure is the magnificence of life; waste, dishonor, and the prodigal son are the disgrace of history.\n\n— Georges Bataille\n\nIt is exactly this subtle shift in gaze that differentiates the abundance mindset from the excess mindset. Waste is not to be discarded with shame, it needs to be proudly embraced. Bataille's call for an economy of excess is not a response to a lack of material abundance. On the contrary, it is the affirmation of abundance which leads him to challenge the prevailing emphasis on efficiency and utility. Bataille observes that this world contains far too much rather than too little energy. This abundance is manifested in the outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life's basic chemical reactions.\n\nCritics of Bataille might argue that his embrace of excess is irresponsible in a world facing resource depletion and environmental degradation. However, this critique misses Bataille's point. He is not advocating for mindless consumption, but rather for a reconsideration of what we value and why. In a world of true abundance, the challenge becomes not how to acquire more, but how to give meaningfully. Affirming the fact of abundance is the starting point of Bataille's economy of excess. It leads him to explore the non-utilitarian, symbolic, and psychological dimensions of human experience that can impossibly be fully satisfied by the purely material. As a result, Bataille ends up reconfiguring societal values and the human relationship with excess and wastefulness.\n\nIn her visionary practice, _Garb-Age_, Shraddha Borawake follows in Bataille's footsteps by shifting the gaze towards the waste that life produces. She constantly blurs the lines between nature, culture, and trash. Tourist memorabilia are framed as if they were high art, throwaway lenses are depicted as if they were precious jewels, and all the garbage together shapes a landscape as breath-taking as those painted by the romantics.\n\n> The menacing pile audaciously boasts a landscape of the truth of use and disuse. Metallic composites stand assembled in a landslide of labels, packaging, logos, words, colors, signifiers and barcodes. Oil, butter, preservatives deodorants and other such containers stand witness to the consumption of a small urban sector. Within this miniscule demographic, it exposes a microscopic slice of a number of the sum total of the global lives and livelihoods; that have resulted in this conglomerate of irreducible substance.\n\n— Shraddha Borawake\n\nBorawake's practice reveals that waste is not external to nature and culture but intrinsic to both. This realization challenges our conventional understanding of these realms, suggesting that they are not discrete, pure entities but rather interconnected, complex systems. Just as waste permeates nature and culture, the logic of garbage — fragmentation, dispersion, and excess — is equally present in these domains.\n\nThis perspective invites us to reconsider our notions of purity and authenticity, not only in culture but also in nature. While we have learned to be critical of such rhetoric in cultural contexts, especially following the atrocities of the Holocaust, nature has largely escaped this scrutiny. Borawake's work extends this critical lens to the natural world, dismantling the idea of nature as a universal, unified whole.\n\nInstead, we are presented with a vision of nature that mirrors the characteristics of waste: dispersed, fragmented, and abundant. This conceptualization aligns with the broader themes of decentralization and excess. Nature, like decentralized systems, is not a monolithic entity but a complex network of interconnected parts.\n\nBy embracing this perspective, we can move beyond the traditional dichotomies of nature versus culture, or purity versus waste. Instead, we can recognize the inherent abundance and excess in all aspects of our world. This shift in understanding has profound implications for how we approach environmental issues, resource management, and even our digital ecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, economies of garbage are not just about waste management or environmental concerns. It is a paradigm shift that encourages us to see the world through the lens of abundance rather than scarcity. By acknowledging the excess inherent in nature, culture, and our technological systems, we open up new possibilities for addressing global challenges. This perspective invites us to reimagine our relationship with the world around us, fostering a more nuanced and holistic approach to the complexities of our interconnected existence.\n","metadata":{"title":"Economy Of Garbage","slug":"economy-of-garbage","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-09-15T10:01:18.899Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":7},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349291,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Economy Of Garbage","rootJobId":"jCsiyq06Pc2h"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787728,1765728787728,,

Rather, the connective powers of electricity, and the technical media built on top of it, will turn the world into a global village. As information travels rapidly across the globe, traditional distinctions between local and global, as well as between different cultures, are eroded. The concept of global village designates a contraction of space and time, creating a sense of simultaneous existence for people worldwide.\n\nTo understand this concept in today's terms, imagine how social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook allow news and trends to spread globally within minutes. A protest in Hong Kong can inspire activists in New York almost instantaneously, exemplifying this collapse of geographical and temporal barriers.\n\nParadoxically, while the implosion of time and space effaces some differences, it accentuates and heightens others. McLuhan prophesizes that an omnipresence of technical media will lead to a new age of tribalism. Besides its homogenizing effects, it will also increase the clashes between cultural, political, and religious tribes. His words ring eerily true in our current digital landscape:\n\n> Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.\n\nThis tribalism manifests in the echo chambers and filter bubbles we see online today. For instance, social media algorithms tend to show us content that aligns with our existing beliefs, reinforcing our \"tribal\" identities. The rise of niche online communities, from Reddit subcultures to Discord servers, further illustrates this digital tribalism.\n\nConsidering the current landscape of the internet, it is safe to say that McLuhan was spot on with his predictions. The modern web is akin to a bustling village. On its busy street corners we find competing tribes. Their members are either claiming and defending the superiority of their own truths and values, or they are disqualifying and ridiculing those of others. It is thus not far-fetched to claim that the term global _village_ also hints at the narrow mindedness of its inhabitants.\n\nYet, these clashes extend far beyond mere content or ideological disputes. In _Gramophone, Film, Typewriter_ (1987), Friedrich Kittler aptly frames the essence of these media wars as a struggle for control over the conduits that transmit words, sounds, and images. Our media are overloaded with entertaining distractions thinly veiled as information. Bread and circus provides a captivating backdrop to the overarching battle for dominion over the channels of communication.\n\nTo put this in contemporary terms, think of the ongoing debates about net neutrality, or the increasing concerns over big tech companies' control of social media platforms. These are modern manifestations of the struggle for control over communication channels that Kittler foresaw.\n\nKittler's observations on this power struggle are particularly illuminating:\n\n> The Pentagon is engaged in far-sighted planning: only the substitution of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare. [...] In the meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to channel-surf between entertainment media.\n\nThis \"pleasure as a by-product\" that Kittler mentions is evident in how we consume media today. While we scroll through entertaining content on TikTok or binge-watch series on Netflix, underlying battles for data control and digital infrastructure are taking place.\n\nCambridge Analytica's manipulation of Facebook data for political purposes, the spread of misinformation during recent elections worldwide, the rebranding of Twitter to X and its policy changes, and the rise of deep fakes are all manifestations of this covert war. Those who are in charge of the channels are freed from the burden to defend their truths and values. Such power dynamics lie at the root of the current internet fragmentation.\n\nIn the face of this complex digital battleground, it's tempting to resort to old dichotomies when looking for perpetrators and saviors. However, in the global village, nothing is simple; every relation is complex. The fact that the government is not your enemy does not make it your friend. Not all companies are evil, but do not trust anyone that says they are not. And despite the name, doing good may not always be the philanthropist's true motivation.\n\nConsider, for example, the dual nature of government surveillance. While it may protect against certain threats, it also raises privacy concerns. Similarly, tech companies often provide valuable services while simultaneously collecting vast amounts of personal data.\n\nAmidst this moral ambiguity, virtue signaling emerges as a curious phenomenon. It needs to be understood as the ultimate sign of moral confusion: an expression of complete and utter doubt. \"Am I truly a good person?\" Any attempt to answer this question is in vain. Instead, we need to short-circuit the tribal, monotheistic logic that underlies it for once and for all.\n\nBy \"tribal, monotheistic logic,\" we mean the tendency to view complex issues in black and white terms, or to believe that there's only one right way of thinking or behaving. This mindset often leads to the polarization we see in online debates about politics, religion, or even pop culture.\n\nWhile there may very well be an objective truth, clear good and evil, and pure beauty, we all have to come to terms with the fact that we will never agree on it. Hence, it does not really matter. Pragmatically, value pluralism is the only way forward. This means acknowledging and respecting the existence of multiple, often conflicting, but equally valid moral and cultural viewpoints.\n\nIn our digital global village, embracing value pluralism could mean actively seeking out diverse perspectives online, engaging in respectful dialogue with those we disagree with, and being open to changing our views. It's about navigating the complexities of our interconnected world with empathy and critical thinking, rather than retreating into the comfort of our digital tribes.\n","metadata":{"title":"Global Village People","slug":"global-village-people","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-08-25T10:09:13.847Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":4},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349300,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Global Village People","rootJobId":"kSYhVYIbeAhG"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787730,1765728787730,,

To me, it marked the beginning of a personal journey that I'm still on today. Over the last 7 years, the way I look at research, learning, and work has completely changed. But in essence, it's all here. In other words, this blogpost is mainly here for nostalgic purposes._\n\nCoding the Humanities is not about technology or even programming. It is all about tools. Software is a blind spot for the humanities. While our discipline is deeply invested in self-reflection, we hardly ever think about the digital tools that we use to produce and disseminate these deep thoughts. As a result, we fail to see the obvious. The applications that facilitate our teaching and research, were not written for us, let alone developed by us. In fact, they are unfit for our needs.\n\nIn our research, we use a wordprocessor for almost everything. This factotum is part of a larger suite of proprietary enterprise applications, which is appropriately named after its intended use context. In an office setting this Swiss army knife may be highly effective, but for research purposes it is rather blunt. Our pimped up typewriter does not offer any form of semantic mark up, has no citation management, and discourages collaboration.\n\nIn teaching, the situation is possibly even more dire. While the omnipresent word processor is a mismatch with our research practice, most online teaching platforms go to the other extreme: they are indistinguishable from it. Or at least its appearance. Their user interfaces exactly mimic the classroom setting. Its conceptual metaphors are sessions, discussions, assignments, etc. This also means, however, that they make little to no effort to actually enhance our practice. Digital tools have the potential to radically change the way scholars teach and students learn. Unfortunately, this promise remains unfulfilled.\n\nEven worse than the inadequacy of the individual research and teaching tools we use, may be the fact that they keep research and teaching completely separated. Of course, it is possible to embed text documents, hyperlinks and presentations in our teaching platforms, but that is about as far as the integration goes. We complain about the ever-increasing disconnect between our teaching and research, but do not realise that our current tools do nothing to help us bridge that gap.\n\nNo matter how bad our workflow is, we do not talk about tools. Humanities' scholars have more important things to discuss. We are interested in content, not in the structures that create it. We thereby selectively ignore most twentieth century theory which should have taught us to focus on the structures that produce knowledge rather than on their results.\n\nHow different is the situation in software development. Programmers shape their work environment until it fits their individual needs. However, this shaping and tweaking does not happen in isolation. It is done in a constant dialogue with the community. Developers fight entire wars over text editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). If they do not like a certain framework or library, they write their own, add missing features, or fork the project. And this process of discussion and deliberation is not limited to the virtual environment. Standing desks, shoes, and dietary regimes are very much part of it.\n\nDeliberate use of tools marks the difference between craftsmanship and dumb labor. By solving all problems with their hammers, humanities' scholars reduce all problems to nails. Appropriate tools not only increase efficiency, they also enhance the ability to differentiate between different problems, and enable solutions to problems that have not even been discovered. Practice, not content, drives a field forwards. It is this very insight that motivates Coding the Humanities.\n","metadata":{"title":"When All We Have is a Hammer","slug":"when-all-we-have-is-a-hammer","status":"published","publishedAt":"2013-12-11T00:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764051785303,"updated":1764265349307,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"When All We Have is a Hammer","rootJobId":"QARYczXBOLr6"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787731,1765728787731,,

This\n  article examines Srinivasan's Network State as digital communities transcend\n  territorial boundaries, building startup societies around shared values rather\n  than contingent geography.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 9\n---\nAn ecosystem is a regenerative practice of continuous, decentralized alignment. The fact that it strives towards the most favorable conditions for most, however, inevitably means that it will not work for all. This brings us to a crucial, and often overlooked, principle that we can learn from nature: the freedom to leave one habitat for another. Healthy ecosystems facilitate the possibility to vote with your feet.\n\nIn nature, organisms move or migrate in response to environmental conditions. This movement is often a direct reaction to factors like food availability, climate conditions, habitat quality, or predation pressure. For example, animals may move to new areas in search of better food sources or more suitable climates. Similarly, plants can also change habitat through seed dispersal, effectively moving to locations with more favorable growth conditions.\n\nVoting with your feet underscores the dynamic nature of ecosystems, where the distribution and abundance of species are constantly shifting in response to changing environmental factors. It also unveils the relativity of boundaries. Where does one habitat end and another begin? Is there a whole, and if so, does it really matter?\n\n> People vote with their feet.\n\n— Milton Friedman\n\nThe desire for the freedom to switch habitats is a decisive argument against the claim that fragmentation is just loss. In fact, it is an affordance that a unified, monolithic whole can never offer, since its inherent universality makes reality all-encompassing and inescapable. To prevent this predicament, there needs to be an out, there needs to be multiplicity. The possibility to vote with your feet is nature's antidote to entrapment and solipsism.\n\nThe privilege to move between different communities or ecosystems is not to be taken lightly. It is a necessary condition for creativity and innovation. Imagination demands the possibility of another habitat. Accessing other realms, even if it is just in the mind, is essential to dream, design, develop, and maintain new, better, or simply different ecosystems.\n\nThis phenomenon is of all ages. As Walter Benjamin showed throughout his work, the history of utopianism and that of architecture are one and the same. Buildings, cities, and parks are yesterday's projection of how tomorrow's ecosystems should look. And in the age of the internet, architecture far exceeds mere physical bricks and mortar.\n\n> Not architecture alone but all technology is, at certain stages, evidence of a collective dream.\n\n— Walter Benjamin\n\nAs a collective dream, the original internet is the last refuge of modernism. Caught in an architectural metaphor, it is best imagined as a huge cathedral that the entire world is building together. Everyone is welcome to inhabit and contribute to this virtual Sagrada Familia. There is one major catch, though: you have to convert to the shared belief system upon entrance. What those on the inside do not realize, however, is that their values are not universal or even universally appealing. Their dream only attracts those who are already converted.\n\nLetting go of that dream of globally shared values should not lead to mourning but be welcomed with a deep sigh of relief. Once we affirm and celebrate value pluralism, the internet will open up realms that go beyond modernism's wildest dreams. To unite the whole world under one roof was never its true promise. From its inception, it blew up the building altogether. The decentralized internet truly enables the creation of spaces that completely defy spatial and temporal boundaries.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan's _The Network State_ (2022) may be this new era's first philosophical masterpiece. Its claim is deceivingly simple: the era of the nation-state is nearing its end. In Srinivasan's view, states no longer need to be defined by their claim on contiguous physical space. The internet has removed the necessity for that requirement:\n\n> What underpins the new dynamic of network states is the intrinsic lack of scarcity of digital territory, the return of unclaimed land and terra nullius, the reopened frontier.\n\n— Balaji Srinivasan\n\nAs it is, digital communities can already provide many of the functions that nation-states used to deliver: a shared identity, a shared history, a shared currency. And if desired, they can even acquire physical real estate. What actually keeps a digital community from being a full-blown state, in Srinivasan's view, is not territory but diplomatic recognition from other states. This, however, is not an impossibility, but simply something that has not happened yet.\n\nDigital ecosystems do not gain diplomatic recognition overnight, and whether this will ever happen is written in the stars. Still, it is undeniable that there are more spatially and temporally dispersed communities now than ever before. In his book, Srinivasan not only pays attention to their ultimate, idealistic manifestation but also explains the various stages of development that these communities go through. A network state starts off as a startup society, then develops into a network archipelago, before it reaches its full potential and acquires diplomatic recognition.\n\nOf these three stages, the first one is most interesting for the current purposes. Startup societies emerge if we look at online communities through the lens of potential instead of flaws. Srinivasan makes the nominalist link with internet startups deliberately. Mind you, this is not because these ecosystems revolve around technological innovation and venture capital. These communities are comparable to startups because they are practices of iteration and validation.\n\nIn the case of a startup society, however, the proposition that needs to be developed is not commercial but ethical in nature. This is the most exciting difference between a nation and a network state. Rather than starting from temporal contingency and physical proximity, startup societies shape around shared values.\n\n> Every new startup society needs to have a moral premise at its core, one that its founding nation subscribes to, one that is supported by a digital history that a more powerful state can't delete, one that justifies its existence as a righteous yet peaceful protest against the powers that be.\n\n— Balaji Srinivasan\n\nFreed from the scarcity of physical space, it becomes much easier for communities of values to coexist with one another. Moreover, their members will no longer be restricted to inhabiting a single habitat at a time. They can be citizens of many different ecosystems, even multiple ones at once. Once people become more aware of this new existential fact, the pressure on existing and new ecosystems to facilitate this basic desire of their citizens will only increase.\n\nFuture ecosystems should be designed first and foremost around the right of their inhabitants to vote with their feet. The idea that people are unconditionally loyal to a ruler, a state, a company, or an ideology is no longer viable. It has always been impossible to fully encapsulate a culture inside its physical borders. Traveling salesmen, academic networks, broadcast networks, and pandemics all broke the illusion of containment. The decentralized internet, however, took this phenomenon to the next level and rendered any attempt to shield an ecosystem from its outside utterly futile.\n\nAny state, organization, or network that continues to restrict the desire to vote with your feet should be met with great skepticism. Forceful entrapment — both physical and ideological — should be treated as an alarming signal. It indicates that there are fundamental flaws in the moral proposition of an ecosystem. Any community that functions around strong shared values does not need to hold on to anyone who does not subscribe to them. On the contrary, healthy ecosystems should encourage their members to imagine, design, and build new, even better spaces.\n","metadata":{"title":"The Good Foot","slug":"the-good-foot","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-10-07T09:08:32.079Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":9},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349315,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"The Good Foot","rootJobId":"Lbcn16jW9veT"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787732,1765728787732,,

In this letter, Marijn Koolen and I argued that the humanities faculty of the University of Amsterdam should invest in us... I mean... online education.\n\nWhy? Because it was a looming threat to traditional institutions? Because it was an easy way to scale up classes and save money? Yes! Definitely! But these weren't the main reason to us. Marijn and I saw in online learning an opportunity to increase the quality of higher education and research.\n\nA few days ago, I rediscovered the proposal that Marijn and I wrote in 2013. What struck me was the following: there is still so much untapped potential in online higher education. But today, most quarantined students are sitting behind a zoom screen attending the same old lecture or seminar.\n\nWhy are educators still treating online as if it is second best? Why is it only used as a substitute when the real thing is unattainable? Online learning can offer so much more than that.\n\nBut there is a second, more personal question that preoccupies me: why weren't we more successful in convincing people? What is missing in our letter? How could we have explained it better? Critically reading the proposal back it becomes crystal clear to me. Marijn and I were sharing our conclusions, but we failed to communicate our journey and convey our enthusiasm.\n\nLet me try again.\n\n## 2013 Redux\n\n> I did not become someone different\n> That I did not want to be\n> But I'm new here\n> Will you show me around?\n\n— Gil Scott-Heron\n\nLet's be frank. The letter that Marijn and I wrote, is not very good. In fact, it's terrible. Seven years later, I'm actually surprised that it took us as far as it did. Our diagnosis is full of broad, inaccurate generalisations. We only hint at alternatives, but they never become concrete or tangible. And last but not least, we were almost obsessively preoccupied with the horrors of MOOCs.\n\nWhat the letter is missing is urgency. Why did we write it in the first place?\n\nThe reason is simple. Marijn and I shared a common passion: programming. A lot of our enthusiasm back in 2013, was sparked by the innovations in online learning that we saw popping up in that space. There were so many different online platforms that tried to teach people how to code in new innovative ways: Codecademy, Gitbook, Peepcode.\n\nTo us, however, there was one platform that was superior to all others: Code School. This now defunct learning platform combined short videos with in-browser coding assignments that were checked automatically. The fact that all their courses had creative themes such as the zombie apocalypse (Rails for Zombies) or Monty Python (Flying through Python) made Code School into nerd nirvana.\n\nIf we were to reverse engineer Code School's secret formula, it would consist of three key ingredients:\n\n**Online is not a Compromise**. Code School realized that they offered a mode of education that was not possible offline and chose to double down on this. Instructors did not try to recreate a classroom vibe. Lessons were somewhere in between 5 to 10 minutes on average. And homework never felt as such.\n\n**Automation is your Friend**. Code School had an in-browser editor where you made your assignments. Through clever usage of unit tests, you got real time feedback on your performance. And when you got stuck, you could get a hint. No human intervention needed.\n\n**Learning should be Fun**. There were so many things that made Code School fun: the aforementioned themes, the gamification, the assignments. But if I had to pick one thing, I'd say the theme songs. Each course would start with its own cheesy tune. They were so catchy, that you could not resist to sing along. But there was a catch, these fun songs actually also contained some valuable lessons. I still remember clearly that \"you have to get the truth out of the DOM\" because of the Anatomy of Backbone theme song.\n\nIn 2013, I thought that I had to convince people that they were doing education wrong. That Marijn and I were experts in online learning. That we were already offering solutions to problems that people didn't even realize that they had yet. In short, we were prophets of rage and doom.\n\nLooking back, I regret that we didn't put more time and effort in conveying our enthusiasm. We should have tried to make others as passionate as us about the future of online education that we saw happening elsewhere. Maybe, just maybe, it would have saved some teachers and students from becoming zoombies of the coronapocalypse in 2020.\n","metadata":{"title":"Learning Apart Together","slug":"learning-apart-together","status":"published","publishedAt":"2020-04-16T00:00:00.000Z"},"created":1764051664549,"updated":1764265438969,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"Learning Apart Together","rootJobId":"BhD4WuxMUnl9"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787733,1765728787733,,

This article introduces the four-phase\n  practice—Align, Validate, Scale, Spin Out—drawing from de Certeau's\n  sieve-order and cellular automata's emergent complexity.\nauthor: Yeehaa\nseriesName: Ecosystem Architecture\nseriesIndex: 10\n---\nMore than ever before, people enjoy the privilege to replace random communities with intentional ones. It is no longer necessary to base our choice of cohabitation based upon spatiotemporal contingency alone. Instead, we can choose to be members of ecosystems that are driven by shared values. Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing such virtual spaces.\n\nBy nature, ecosystems cannot be developed in a traditional, controlled manner. Both decentralized and regenerative design thus teach us to work bottom-up rather than top-down. Complex systems are not planned, they emerge and are then groomed and cultivated. Hence, there cannot be a blueprint, a project planning, a reliable budget, and so on. Nonetheless, that does not mean that there is no room for overview, structure, and order. It just means that order no longer has any form of hierarchical precedence over practice. As a matter of fact, the act of creating overview should itself be considered as an expression of practice.\n\nIn his essay 'Walking the City' from _The Practice of Everyday Life_ (1984), Michel de Certeau describes this new perspective on structure as follows:\n\n> Things extra and other (details and excesses coming from elsewhere) insert themselves into the accepted framework, the imposed order. One thus has the very relationship between spatial practices and the imposed order. The surface of this order is everywhere punched and torn open by ellipsis, drifts, and leaks of meaning: it is a sieve-order.\n\n— Michel de Certeau\n\nDe Certeau carefully demonstrates that practice is not simply the diametrical opposite of order. Practitioners actually realize a structure by breaking or changing it. Conformation and playfulness are two sides of the same coin. Which one of the two we choose to focus on is contextual. For mastery and recognition, conformation is crucial. In order to be recognized as a great practitioner, you first have to master the rules of your craft. For innovation and creativity, however, conformation alone will never suffice. There playfulness is key.\n\nMoreover, innovation is not even always something intentional. Even practices that are mostly aimed at conformation inevitably break the rules in interesting ways on a regular basis. Still, that does not take away from the fact that practitioners that consciously walk the line between conforming to the rules and breaking them are more likely to innovate than those that obediently color within the lines.\n\nUltimately, however, it may be those practices that define their own set of rules that may be most fruitful for innovation. In _The Creative Act_, Rick Rubin describes this as follows:\n\n> Innovation exists only within those rules. As artists, we get to create a new set of rules each and every time we play. After careful consideration, we may choose to break them in the midst of a project if a discovery impels us. While it's easy to make these changes, there's little use to rules if they are not taken seriously.\n\n— Rick Rubin\n\nCellular automata are arguably the purest manifestation of this very idea. They are discrete units, typically arranged in a grid of cells. Each cell can be in one of a finite number of states, with its state at any given time determined by a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. These rules are iteratively applied, allowing the system to evolve.\n\nRemarkably, despite their simplicity, cellular automata can produce a wide array of behaviors, from stable, repeating patterns to chaotic and unpredictable dynamics. This characteristic makes them not only valuable for studying complex phenomena in physics, biology, and computer science, but also for creating generative art.\n\nIn generative art, cellular automata are used to create intricate and often unexpected visual or sonic patterns, with each iteration of the rule set leading to the generation of new and unique artistic designs. This intersection of science and art highlights the versatility and creative potential of cellular automata in modeling both natural processes and emergent creativity.\n\nCellular automata were made famous — and are often erroneously identified with — Conway's Game of Life. In this game without players, cells are randomly or intentionally placed on a two-dimensional grid. All subsequent moves are made according to the following four, deterministic rules:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nWhether or not the initial distribution will lead to a captivating movement or an aesthetically pleasing pattern is fully deterministic. Paradoxically, though, it is also nearly impossible to predict in advance due to emergent complexity. As a matter of fact, most distributions will lead to rapid stagnation or complete demise. Still, some of them result in vibrant, healthy ecosystems. Finding those rare configurations that have such an emergent quality is both an intellectual and artistic challenge.\n\nConway's Game of Life demonstrates how a few simple rules can create complex spaces from which surprising innovations can emerge. While the rules of the game — along with the size of the grid, and numbers of dimensions — can greatly vary, all cellular automata work in a similar way. Since the rules decide which cells will live or die, they are ethical in the truest sense of the word. Rules are the reflection of the system's underlying values. Ecosystem architecture is the practice that designs said rules. Whereas the execution of such rules is deterministic and precise, their creation itself is quite the opposite. It is a creative act.\n\nBeing a practice, thus, means that ecosystem architecture is performed rather than executed. That does not mean that a structure is completely absent, though. Similar to other creative practices, practitioners can fall back on an archetypical structure. Just like a tragedy has five acts (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution) the practice of ecosystem architecture is defined by four sequential movements:\n\n### 1. Align\n\nThis first movement is mostly about asking questions. What is the moral challenge that needs to be solved? Who are the people waiting for a solution? What would it take for them to join our community? What would be potential reasons for them to say no to it? How would our proposed ecosystem look like concretely? Which values does it embrace? What rules would it implement?\n\nIn the alignment phase, it is important to move our temporal horizon a bit further away, preferably 5 to 10 years from now. Far enough that the imagination can be triggered, close enough so that our choices are still consequential. How would the proposed ecosystem ideally look like then? What affordances do its members have that they currently lack? How does this future deal with our core moral challenge?\n\nThe answers to these questions are then documented in a so-called **vision type**. A vision type is similar to a prototype, but shows the ideal, fully developed version of our proposition rather than its initial state. This living document can then be used for further research, alignment, and validation.\n\n### 2. Validate\n\nOnce the initial stakeholders are aligned, it is time to test whether they are willing to put their money where their mouth is: literally or figuratively. Just like alignment, validation is a practice that should be performed continuously throughout the entire process of ecosystem architecture. In this phase, however, validation is the sole purpose. The goal is to acquire measurable buy-in from prospective ecosystem members.\n\nSimilar to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in startup development, your validation data should be based on a miniature version of your complete proposition. But in this case, we are testing more than just the willingness to purchase. We are validating the commitment to change, that is why we call this first tangible artifact a **vessel of transformation**.\n\nAn vessel of transformation demonstrates that participants are ready to become active co-creators of a new ecosystem. This is vital because ecosystems, unlike products, cannot be consumed passively – they require ongoing cultivation and contribution from all members. For instance, while an MVP for a community platform might test whether people will sign up and engage with content, a vessel of transformation would test whether they are willing to take on leadership roles, contribute resources, and actively shape the community's direction. This deeper level of validation is essential because ecosystem architecture is not just about building successful products or services – it is about catalyzing lasting social transformation.\n\nA vessel of transformation can be very concrete (a website or an app) or more abstract (an event format or a crowdfunding campaign). What is important is the fact that all the crucial stakeholders commit to our vision with more than just inconsequential words.\n\n### 3. Scale\n\nAfter our vessel of transformation has been launched successfully, and we have acquired enough validation evidence to move forward comfortably, it is time to scale our ecosystem. Rather than being radically different, this phase mainly consists of more alignment and validation. Now, however, these are done in a more granular and periodic fashion. Making the process in this stage more iterative than disruptive.\n\nThe goal of this phase is to make our efforts entirely redundant. All functionality that we provide should be slowly taken over by other partners and stakeholders. Once the ecosystem does no longer rely on our role as an initiator at all anymore, it can be designated a **minimum viable ecosystem**.\n\n### 4. Spin Out\n\nWhile the previous phases all share a lot with startup theory, this last phase is actually its complete opposite. In this last phase, there is only one action involved. Better yet, it is a non-action: letting go. The ecosystem — that is now hopefully thriving — is not going to be led by us, part of our empire, or controlled by our holding company. We can still be a part of it, of course, but as one member amongst many.\n\nThis is not a selfless act, mind you. If the earlier phases were performed correctly, the collective gains should now also benefit us. We just have no control over it any longer. In the end ecosystem architecture is more akin to farming than to business model generation. We plant our seeds, nurture them, and then reap what we sow.\n","metadata":{"title":"The Practice Of Ecosystem Architecture","slug":"the-practice-of-ecosystem-architecture","status":"published","publishedAt":"2024-10-23T09:40:15.186Z","seriesName":"Ecosystem Architecture","seriesIndex":10},"created":1763959389014,"updated":1764265349330,"contentWeight":1,"operation":"create"},,entity-service,{"operationType":"data_processing","operationTarget":"The Practice Of Ecosystem Architecture","rootJobId":"RQUu74d3DeSK"},pending,0,0,3,,1765728787735,1765728787735,,
