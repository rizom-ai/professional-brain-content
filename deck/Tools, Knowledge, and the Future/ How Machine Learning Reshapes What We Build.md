description: >-
  An exploration of how tools—particularly machine learning
  systems—fundamentally shape knowledge production, organizational design, and
  the future of work. Drawing on philosophy, technology, and lived experience,
  this presentation examines why understanding the relationship between tools
  and knowledge is critical for building the next generation of organizations.

# Tools, Knowledge, and the Future: How Machine Learning Reshapes What We Build

---

## The Problem We Face

- We treat tools as neutral—merely instruments that amplify human intention
- But tools fundamentally *shape* what we can think, build, and know
- Machine learning accelerates this reshaping at unprecedented scale
- Most organizations haven't reckoned with this reality yet

---

## Tools Shape Knowledge Production

- The tools we use determine what questions we can ask
- They constrain what we can see and what remains invisible
- A hammer makes everything look like a nail
- Machine learning systems define entire categories of what's "knowable"

**The stakes:** If we don't understand how our tools work, we don't understand what we're actually building

---

## Machine Learning: A New Kind of Tool

- Not just faster computation—it's a fundamentally different way of producing knowledge
- Learns patterns from data rather than following explicit rules
- Creates "black boxes" that make decisions we can't fully explain
- Shapes organizations, markets, and human behavior at scale

**The question:** What does it mean to build with tools we don't fully understand?

## From Machines to Living Systems

Traditional organizations:
- Designed like machines: hierarchical, rule-based, predictable
- Tools reinforce this: spreadsheets, org charts, command-and-control

Living systems organizations:
- Adaptive, emergent, self-organizing
- Tools need to support emergence, not suppress it
- Machine learning could enable this—or entrench control further

## Communicating Vision in the Age of Algorithms

To advocate for transformative ideas today:
- Convey not just conclusions, but the *journey* that created them
- Show lived experience and passion, not just data
- Help others understand *why* this matters, not just *what* works
- Navigate a world where algorithms increasingly mediate meaning

---

## Building What Comes Next

Three principles:

1. **Understand your tools** - Know how they shape what you can build
2. **Design for emergence** - Create structures that work like living systems
3. **Communicate the why** - Help others see the vision, not just the mechanism

---

## The Future is Collaborative

- No single lineage holds the answer (Afrofuturism, DAOs, mesh networks, philosophy)
- We need ecosystem architects who understand both technology and culture
- The goal: build something inhabitable, not just functional
- This requires thinking differently about tools, knowledge, and organization

---

## What's Your Role?

- Are you building tools or being shaped by them?
- What would it mean to design organizations as living systems?
- How do we ensure machine learning serves human flourishing?

**The invitation:** Join in building infrastructure for the organizations we actually need.
