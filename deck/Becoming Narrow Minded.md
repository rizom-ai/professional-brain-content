# Becoming Narrow Minded

## AI: A Case for Low-Hanging Fruit

---

## Goal

To show that combining many single-purpose **narrow AIs** often is a better
approach to solving real world problems than to focus on **general AI
moonshots**

---

## Agenda

1. What is Rizom?
2. Low End Theory
3. In Practice

---

## What is Rizom?

---

### Rizom

Knowledge infrastructure that works like a **virtual coworker**—devoted to
information management across your tools and teams

---

### Virtual Coworker

**Moderates** your team's communication on messaging apps

**Organizes** the valuable knowledge that these messages contain

**Augments** this knowledge base with information from other sources

---

## Low End Theory

---

### General AI

> "The hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any
> intellectual task that a human being can."

— Wikipedia

---

### Narrow AI

> "A term used to describe artificial intelligence systems that are specified
> to handle a singular or limited task."

— deepai.org

---

### Moonshot

> "An extremely ambitious project or mission undertaken to achieve a monumental
> goal."

— Merriam-Webster

---

### The Problem

The **combined promise** of general AI and moonshots never panned out. It hasn't
led to the promised breakthroughs, while other solvable real-world problems
are being ignored.

---

### Our Approach

**Radical Automation**: Automate every laborious and boring chore that can be
automated. Any missed opportunity to do so inevitably results in talent waste.

**Human In The Loop**: On collaborative messaging apps, it is childishly simple
to put an AI in a continuous feedback loop with its users.

**Low-Hanging Fruit**: While hardly ever successful, most AI initiatives focus
on moonshots. We take the opposite approach—deliberately tackling the 90% first.

### AI Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| ----- | ---------- |
| NLP | spaCy, Compromise |
| Classification | TensorFlow.js |
| Rules | Custom rule engines |
| Integration | Slack, Microsoft Teams |

---

## In Practice

---

### Feature Development Flow

1. Isolate a specific problem
2. Explore existing message patterns
3. Project desired outcomes
4. Determine data requirements and methods

---

### Synchronize

**Problem**: Information overload after absence from messaging apps

**Data**: Trello boards, meeting notes, message history

**Method**: Rule-based filtering, NLP summarization

---

### Onboarding

**Problem**: Tacit knowledge is hard for new team members to grasp

**Data**: Channel history, pinned messages, shared documents

**Method**: Context extraction, FAQ generation

---

### Research

**Problem**: Shared links rarely get read or processed, creating knowledge gaps

**Data**: Shared URLs, link metadata, discussion context

**Method**: Content extraction, automatic categorization, knowledge graph

---

## Conclusion

Combining many single-purpose narrow AIs is often a better approach to solving
real world problems than focusing on general AI moonshots.

The future isn't one superintelligent system—it's many specialized tools working
together with humans in the loop.
