The Brains platform is built on a few core ideas:

- **Plugin-based**: Every capability is a plugin. Blogging, social media, chat, website building — all plugins that can be added or removed.
- **Entity-driven**: All data is stored as entities with markdown content and structured metadata. Notes, posts, products, identities — all entities.
- **AI-native**: AI is not an add-on. It's woven into every layer — content generation, knowledge extraction, conversation.
- **Markdown-first**: All content is stored as human-readable markdown files. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats.
- **Message-based**: Plugins communicate through a message bus. This keeps them decoupled and composable.

Each brain is a configuration of these pieces — a model tailored to a specific use case.
