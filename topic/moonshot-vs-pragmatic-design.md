# Moonshot vs. Pragmatic Design

## Summary
The post contrasts Google's high-impact moonshot approach with a pragmatic philosophy that focuses on solving everyday problems with minimal resources. It critiques the proliferation of copycat moonshot factories and advocates for addressing low-hanging fruit rather than pursuing exponential-impact solutions.

## Content
The essay begins by examining Google X's moonshot factory model, which was established in 2010 with a mission to invest only in ideas capable of 10x impact over the status quo. The moonshot concept, popularized by JFK's Apollo program, promises to solve nearly impossible problems through massive resource investment. Google X's three-step formula: focus on an unsolvable problem, spend significant money on it, and sell the resulting solution. However, the author argues that despite inspiring marketing and media coverage, X's moonshots have failed to meaningfully address world's biggest problems. The essay then critiques the wave of copycat moonshot factories that emerged over the following decade, noting that these organizations modified the original formula by focusing on fashionable rather than unsolvable problems and seeking outrageous amounts of funding rather than solving actual issues. The author contrasts this with Rizom's deliberate choice to pursue 'low-end theory'—solving small, everyday problems that others ignore using the simplest technology possible. Examples include onboarding new staff members, organizing shared team links, and summarizing missed messages. The philosophy rejects ego and glory in favor of practical impact, finding satisfaction in doing necessary work that no one else cares about. The core argument is that meaningful progress comes not from pursuing impossible problems with unlimited resources, but from systematically solving accessible problems with minimal means.
