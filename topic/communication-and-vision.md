# Communication and Vision

## Summary
The challenge of effectively communicating innovative ideas and inspiring others to embrace new perspectives, particularly when advocating for transformative change. The discussion reflects on how sharing conclusions without conveying enthusiasm, journey, and urgency undermines persuasive impact and adoption of new concepts.

## Content
The author's reflection on the failed 2013 proposal reveals a critical lesson about communication and vision-sharing. While the proposal contained valid ideas about online education, it failed because the authors were preoccupied with diagnosis and problems (particularly criticisms of MOOCs) rather than sharing their passion and the underlying reasons for their convictions. The letter lacked urgency and concrete, tangible alternatives - it presented broad generalizations without demonstrating the journey that led them to their conclusions. The author identifies that they approached the proposal as experts pronouncing that educators were 'doing education wrong,' adopting a prophetic tone of 'rage and doom' rather than inviting others into their enthusiasm. Seven years later, the author regrets not investing more effort in conveying passion and making others as excited about the future of online education as they were. This reflection suggests that transformative ideas require not just logical arguments but emotional engagement, concrete examples, and shared enthusiasm. The lesson extends beyond education: effective advocacy for change requires communicating both the vision and the passion behind it, helping others understand the journey and feel the urgency, rather than simply presenting conclusions.
