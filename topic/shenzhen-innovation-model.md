The essay references Shenzhen's approach to innovation as a counterpoint to Western moonshot thinking, describing how counterfeit moonshooters modify the original formula through selective adoption and adaptation—adding features while removing others. This alludes to Shenzhen's characteristic pragmatism of taking existing ideas and making practical modifications rather than pursuing revolutionary breakthroughs. The reference suggests an alternative innovation paradigm based on iteration, adaptation, and making do with available resources, which contrasts sharply with the exponential logic and massive resource investment demanded by moonshot culture.
