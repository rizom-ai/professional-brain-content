# Shenzhen Innovation Model

## Summary
A reference to the Shenzhen approach of iterative product development through copying, modifying, and improving existing designs rather than pursuing original innovation from scratch. This model is contrasted with the moonshot approach and represents an alternative innovation philosophy.

## Content
The piece references 'Shenzhen fashion' when describing how copycat moonshot factories modify Google X's original formula—adding features and removing others rather than creating entirely new frameworks. This alludes to Shenzhen's well-known approach to innovation where manufacturers take existing products, make incremental modifications, and improve them through rapid iteration. Unlike the Western emphasis on original breakthroughs or moonshot thinking, the Shenzhen model accepts that innovation can come from thoughtful adaptation and improvement of existing solutions. This approach is pragmatic and results-oriented, focusing on what works rather than what's theoretically perfect. The author uses this reference positively to suggest that the counterfeit moonshot factories, while criticized for copying, are actually following a more practical innovation methodology than the original. This hints at a broader philosophy that borrows from multiple traditions and cultures—a key part of ecosystem architecture thinking that draws from Afrofuturism, Shanzhai culture, and other non-Western innovation approaches.
