# Social Contracts

## Summary
The true foundation of democratic societies lies not in formal institutions or constitutions, but in functioning social contracts—shared, aligned values that citizens collectively subscribe to. The COVID pandemic revealed that when social contracts break down, institutional structures become meaningless, as people readily abandon constitutional protections for perceived immediate benefits.

The author argues that institutions are only effective when built upon a functioning social contract. For approximately 70 years, democratic societies were protected not by constitutional documents themselves, but by widespread agreement on shared values and commitments. COVID exposed this reality when citizens across the political spectrum willingly suspended constitutional protections, revealing that the constitution was merely a 'suspension of disbelief'—the 'Disneyfication' of democracy. The institutional bankruptcy is evident globally: Israel's disregard for UN resolutions faces no meaningful consequences, and all sides of the political spectrum dismiss institutions when they don't serve particular interests. The solution requires rebuilding social contracts (plural) through renewed conversations about collective values and commitments. This foundation of aligned values must be constantly debated and negotiated to create institutions that balance individual rights with shared responsibilities. Without a functioning social contract, formal institutional structures lack legitimacy and cannot withstand political division.
