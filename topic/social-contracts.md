# Social Contracts

## Content
The article argues that functioning social contracts, not institutional structures, are the true foundation of healthy democracies. Yeehaa contends that constitutions and public institutions have failed to protect democracy because the underlying social contract—the shared, aligned values citizens subscribe to—has broken down. The COVID pandemic exemplified this breakdown, revealing that citizens were willing to suspend constitutional protections when institutions no longer served their perceived interests. Rather than attempting to repair existing institutions, the author emphasizes that rebuilding must begin with renegotiating fundamental social contracts that establish common values and collective commitments. This requires ongoing debate and negotiation to align individual rights with shared responsibilities.
