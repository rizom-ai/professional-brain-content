# Social Contracts

## Content
The article argues that the true foundation of healthy democratic states is not institutions themselves, but rather functioning social contracts—the shared, aligned values to which citizens subscribe. The author contends that constitutions have historically functioned as a "suspension of disbelief" rather than genuine protections against democratic decay. COVID revealed this fundamental weakness when citizens willingly suspended constitutional protections for perceived short-term gains, demonstrating that institutions only hold legitimacy when they serve particular interests. The breakdown of social contracts across the political spectrum has rendered traditional institutions ineffective, suggesting that rebuilding civil societies requires reconstructing these foundational agreements through ongoing debate and negotiation of common values.
