# AI Winters as Evolutionary Events

## Content
The deck reframes AI winters not as failures but as selection pressures that shaped the field's trajectory. The first winter (1974-1980) eliminated bottom-up learning approaches in favor of rule-based control, while the second winter (1987-1993) rejected systems attempting to model human reasoning in favor of statistical scaling. Each winter systematically selected against emergence and distributed intelligence, pushing the field toward centralized, controllable architectures. This historical analysis reveals a pattern: the AI field has consistently chosen systems optimized for control and predictability over systems capable of genuine emergence. Understanding these selection events is crucial for recognizing what paths were abandoned and what alternative futures might be possible.
