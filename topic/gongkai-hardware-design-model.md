# Gongkai Hardware Design Model

## Summary
Gongkai is an open sharing practice in Shenzhen's shanzhai ecosystem where manufacturers freely distribute hardware blueprints, bills of materials, and component sources. This network-based approach to intellectual property enables rapid collaborative innovation and surpasses Western open source methodologies for hardware development.

## Content
Gongkai (meaning 'open' or 'to make public') represents a fundamentally different approach to intellectual property and innovation compared to Western models. Unlike the Western 'broadcast' view where innovation is credited to specific authors and society pays royalties, China's 'network' view emphasizes standing on the shoulders of others and trading ideas as favors. In the shanzhai ecosystem, manufacturers share intricate blueprints outlining device design and structure, along with detailed bills of materials specifying required components and their sources. This cultivates a dynamic collaborative environment where ideas and designs flow freely. Gongkai is particularly suited for open hardware development, as it allows hardware hackers to access current components and designs rather than being forced to use outdated expensive components or resort to reverse engineering. This model has enabled the shanzhai to create a vibrant ecosystem capable of iterating and innovating at incredible speed while maintaining resilience.
