# Cellular Automata as Design Model

## Content
Cellular automata serve as a powerful model for understanding emergent ecosystem behavior, where simple rule sets create complex, often unpredictable dynamics. Conway's Game of Life exemplifies this principle with just four deterministic rules governing cell survival and reproduction, yet producing vastly different outcomes based on initial conditions. Despite being deterministic, cellular automata are nearly impossible to predict in advance due to emergent complexity—most configurations lead to stagnation while rare ones create vibrant, healthy patterns. This intersection of simplicity and complexity demonstrates how ecosystems can be governed by clear ethical rules while remaining creative and generative, applicable both to natural processes and organizational design.
