# Surveillance Capitalism

## Summary
Surveillance capitalism represents a systemic threat where corporations and governments weaponize behavioral data to predict and control human behavior. The article argues that naive expansion of internet connectivity only amplifies this exploitation, making it critical to establish aligned values before connecting systems.

## Content
Shoshana Zuboff's concept of surveillance capitalism describes how corporations and governments unilaterally claim human experience as raw material for translation into behavioral data. The dangerous intersection occurs when former adversaries (corporations and governments) align around shared interests in controlling behavior through data analysis. Unlike earlier ideals of a decentralized internet that promised ownership and autonomy, surveillance capitalism exploits connectivity itself as a tool for behavioral prediction and preemption. The article emphasizes that simply providing more internet access without addressing underlying power structures feeds into this vicious cycle. To counter this future, alignment must precede connection—people need to understand their needs, see tangible alternatives, and choose between them rather than defaulting to the most probable (status quo) outcome.
