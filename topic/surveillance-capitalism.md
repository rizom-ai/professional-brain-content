# Surveillance Capitalism

## Summary
Surveillance capitalism represents a systemic threat where corporations and governments weaponize behavioral data to control human behavior and predict actions. The article examines how this model exploits human experience as raw material and why naive connectivity expansion only amplifies this exploitation cycle.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as defined by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments share a vested interest in connecting more people to gather larger amounts of granular data, allowing them to predict and preempt human actions. The dangerous irony is that expanding internet access without proper safeguards feeds into this cycle of exploitation. Zuboff's framework reveals how former adversaries (corporations and governments) have aligned around a shared interest in behavioral control. Data serves as their primary weapon, analyzed to identify patterns that enable prediction and manipulation at scale. The article argues that naively providing better connectivity without addressing alignment and values only accelerates this dystopian trajectory.
