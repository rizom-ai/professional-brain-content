# Cassettes as Extensible Modules

## Content
Cassettes are reusable, single-purpose functions designed to lower the barrier to entry for community members who want to contribute new features to a bot ecosystem without requiring deep technical expertise. Each cassette hooks into one of the bot's states, allowing modular composition of bot behaviors through a plug-and-play architecture. This approach democratizes bot development by separating the complex state machine logic from the specific implementations that community members can create and share. Cassettes embody a philosophy of accessibility and participatory design, enabling creative and critical communities to extend the platform's capabilities in ways that reflect their unique needs and values. By treating each bot function as a standalone, reusable module, the cassette model transforms bots from fixed tools into evolving systems that grow with community input.
