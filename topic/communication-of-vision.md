# Communication of Vision

## Summary
Effective advocacy for new approaches requires more than logical arguments and solutions; it demands conveying genuine enthusiasm and taking audiences on an intellectual journey. The author reflects on how a 2013 proposal failed partly because it presented conclusions without sharing the passion and discovery process that led to them.

## Content
The author's critical retrospective on his 2013 proposal with Marijn Koolen reveals that its failure wasn't primarily due to flawed reasoning but to poor communication strategy. The original letter presented broad generalizations, vague hints at alternatives, and an almost obsessive focus on critiquing MOOCs, but lacked urgency and genuine enthusiasm. Most critically, it shared conclusions without conveying the journey that led to those conclusions. The authors' actual motivation came from their shared passion for programming and their discovery of innovative online learning platforms like Codecademy, Gitbook, Peepcode, and especially Code School. This enthusiasm for what was already being demonstrated elsewhere in the tech education space was the real driving force, but this passion never made it into the formal proposal. The author reflects that a more effective approach would have been to help others become as passionate as they were about the future of online education, rather than positioning themselves as experts warning of doom. This is a meta-commentary on how transformative ideas spread: they require not just logical arguments but emotional engagement, storytelling, and the ability to bring others along on a discovery journey. The author's regret is that 'we didn't put more time and effort in conveying our enthusiasm,' suggesting that the quality of the vision itself was sound but the communication vehicle was inadequate.
