# Excess Economics & Abundance

## Summary
An exploration of how Bataille's economy of excess and abundance mindset challenges scarcity-driven capitalism. The discussion examines how shifting from extraction and waste disposal to embracing excess as a fundamental aspect of nature and culture creates a paradigm shift in economic and philosophical thinking.

## Content
The article examines Bataille's economy of excess as a fundamental challenge to capitalism's scarcity-based organizing principle. Rather than viewing waste as shameful disposal, Bataille advocates for proudly embracing expenditure and excess, arguing that the world contains far too much rather than too little energy—manifested in solar energy and life's chemical surpluses. This is not about mindless consumption but a reconsideration of what we value and why. The abundance mindset differs from the excess mindset in that it recognizes true material abundance and shifts focus from acquisition to meaningful giving. Shraddha Borawake's Garb-Age practice exemplifies this philosophy by reframing garbage as intrinsic to both nature and culture, not external to them. Her work reveals waste as permeating all domains and challenges conventional notions of purity and authenticity. The perspective extends to nature itself, presenting it not as a unified whole but as a complex, dispersed, fragmented network—mirroring the characteristics of waste. This paradigm shift has profound implications for environmental issues, resource management, and digital ecosystems, inviting a reimagined relationship with the world based on recognition of inherent abundance rather than scarcity.
