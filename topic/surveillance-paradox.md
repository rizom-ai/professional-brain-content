# Surveillance Paradox

## Content
The essay identifies a critical problem in contemporary digital culture: the collapse of trust relations across both online and offline spaces, where governments distrust citizens, citizens distrust governments, and individuals must navigate an information landscape where facts themselves are contested. This environment of suspicion has created a false binary where users are forced to choose between surrendering personal data or forgoing digital participation. The author argues that tightening security measures in response to this distrust paradox typically backfires, weakening trust relations further rather than strengthening them. Understanding this paradox is essential for designing digital systems that actually increase safety and foster genuine community rather than enforcing compliance through surveillance and control mechanisms.
