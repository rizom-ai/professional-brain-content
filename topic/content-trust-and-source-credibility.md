# Content Trust and Source Credibility

## Summary
This topic explores the challenge of distinguishing fact from fiction in modern media and proposes a solution centered on evaluating the credibility of information sources rather than analyzing content itself. The discussion shifts focus from fact-checking individual pieces of information to assessing the trustworthiness and track record of the agents producing that information.

## Content
The problem of fake news is traditionally framed as a content-level issue where facts and lies are difficult to distinguish. However, the author argues this approach is fundamentally flawed and proposes an alternative: instead of trying to verify every piece of information, focus on the agent responsible for spreading it. This is illustrated through a personal anecdote about the author's experience as school newspaper editor, where fake news was created intentionally by mixing facts with rumors and fiction. The dean's response—removing the problematic agent rather than debating the truth of individual stories—demonstrates an effective approach. This leads to the concept of an Organic Governance System that tracks information sources through reputation scoring. The system works by: (1) associating information with specific agents, (2) adjusting the agent's reputation score based on contribution quality, (3) amplifying or reducing the reach of contributions based on reputation, and (4) removing agents whose reputation falls below a threshold. The ultimate goal is to transform online communities from chaotic information spaces into functioning meritocracies where quality contributions are rewarded and unreliable sources lose influence.
