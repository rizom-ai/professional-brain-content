# Product Vision Inspiration

## Content
Marty Cagan explores the concept of visiontypes—prototypes that communicate and inspire product vision—using the iconic example of Steve Jobs' visit to Xerox PARC. Rather than simply copying existing technology, Jobs was inspired by what he saw to envision what a desktop computer could become, demonstrating how powerful visions can transform industries. The article emphasizes that visiontypes serve as catalysts for innovation by inspiring teams and attracting talent to ambitious goals. However, Cagan cautions that inspiration alone is insufficient; the real work of innovation emerges through extensive problem and solution discovery that follows the initial vision. Drawing from his experience at HP Labs, where teams were inspired by PARC and MIT's Media Lab but failed to productize their vision due to poor technology choices, Cagan illustrates that translating vision into actual customer value requires rigorous discovery and execution beyond the initial inspiration.
