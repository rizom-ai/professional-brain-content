# Online Education Innovation

## Summary
The potential of online learning to enhance educational quality beyond traditional classroom models, with emphasis on pedagogical innovation rather than cost-cutting or scaling. The discussion explores how online platforms can leverage technology and design to create fundamentally different and superior learning experiences compared to conventional in-person instruction.

## Content
In 2013, the author and Marijn Koolen proposed that the University of Amsterdam invest in online education not primarily for cost savings or scaling, but to increase the quality of higher education. They were inspired by innovative online learning platforms in the programming space, particularly Code School, which demonstrated three key principles for successful online education: (1) Online is not a Compromise - recognizing that online education offers modes of learning impossible offline, with shorter lessons (5-10 minutes) and assignments that don't feel like traditional homework; (2) Automation is your Friend - using in-browser editors, real-time feedback through unit tests, and hints to provide immediate performance feedback without human intervention; (3) Learning should be Fun - incorporating themes, gamification, and creative elements like course theme songs that make learning engaging while embedding educational content. The author reflects on why their 2013 proposal failed, identifying that they shared conclusions rather than conveying enthusiasm and the journey. By 2020, despite the shift to online learning during COVID-19, most educators still treat online as a second-best substitute for traditional lectures rather than leveraging its unique potential. The author regrets not better communicating their vision and passion for online education's future, which could have prevented the reduction of online learning to basic Zoom lectures.
