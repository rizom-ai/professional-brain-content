# Ecosystem Architecture & Organizational Design

## Summary
Yeehaa's core practice focuses on designing organizations as living systems rather than machines, drawing from diverse intellectual traditions including philosophy, Afrofuturism, DAOs, and mesh networks. This approach addresses how contemporary tools and contexts have outgrown traditional organizational models, requiring structures that enable communities to thrive.

## Content
Yeehaa came to technology through continental philosophy (Heidegger, Bataille, Benjamin, Kittler), recognizing that fundamental questions about knowledge, community, and meaning were being answered by those building digital infrastructure. The core conviction is that new kinds of organizations require new kinds of tools. Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing and cultivating organizations as living systems rather than machines—not rejecting hierarchy outright, but acknowledging that our tools and contexts have evolved beyond what traditional models can handle. This philosophy borrows promiscuously from multiple lineages: Afrofuturism, Shanzhai culture, DAOs, and mesh networks. The goal is not to restore a golden age, but to build something genuinely inhabitable. This is demonstrated through projects like Offcourse (reimagining education outside institutional walls) and current work on Rizom (knowledge infrastructure for organizations working like living systems). The practice emphasizes that the future emerges from multiple lineages and diverse sources, not singular traditions.
