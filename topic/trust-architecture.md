# Trust Architecture

## Summary
The post explores how trust relationships are built and maintained in digital and social contexts, contrasting security-focused approaches with trust-based networks. It argues that sustainable safety requires moving beyond encryption and access control to foster evidence-based trust relationships between organizations and users.

The fundamental challenge of contemporary society is the erosion of trust relations both offline and online. Citizens distrust governments, consumers face Faustian tradeoffs between privacy and social participation, and distinguishing trustworthy information sources has become nearly impossible. Historically, code and security measures were developed to establish secure communication amid suspicion, creating a paradox: secure networks often come at the expense of actual trust. The internet has invested heavily in security technology but far less in trustworthiness itself. Security measures alone have repeatedly failed to create safer digital spaces, and sometimes backfired. The solution lies in examining the opposite direction: building networks of trust. The spam filtering example illustrates this perfectly—early blacklist and domain-blocking approaches failed, but when ISPs shifted to reputation lists and whitelisting (building networks of trusted partners), effectiveness dramatically improved. This pattern repeats in anti-virus software history. To make the internet safer, we must invest in coalitions of actual people and organizations rather than relying solely on algorithmic or anecdotal trust. Public Badges are proposed as a mechanism for organizations to collect and communicate evidence-based values, enabling trust relations built on verifiable evidence rather than reputation or institutional claims. The underlying conviction is that sustainable safety cannot be built on security alone—it must be built on trust.
