# Cassette System

## Content
Cassettes are reusable, single-purpose functions that lower the barrier for community members to extend bot capabilities without deep technical expertise. By hooking into specific states within the bot state machine, cassettes enable modular feature development where new functionality can be added incrementally. This design pattern transforms bot development from a centralized engineering effort into a distributed, community-driven process. The cassette approach acknowledges that knowledge-heavy, multi-disciplinary communities benefit from tools that can be extended by domain experts rather than requiring all innovation to flow through specialized developers. This democratization of tool-building aligns with Rizom's philosophy of creating infrastructure that empowers communities rather than constraining them.
