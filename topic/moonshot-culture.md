# Moonshot Culture

## Content
The post examines the moonshot framework popularized by Google X, which aims for 10x impact through massive resource investment in seemingly unsolvable problems. The author traces the concept's origins from Kennedy's Apollo program through Google's experimental factory model, which follows a repeatable three-step formula: identify an unsolvable problem, spend significant resources, and commercialize the solution. However, the post critiques how this approach has inspired numerous imitators across the tech industry who adopt the moonshot rhetoric without the resources or genuine commitment to solving complex problems. The proliferation of counterfeit moonshot factories reveals how the original formula has been diluted and commodified, with entrepreneurs now marketing grandiose visions of curing cancer and ending poverty rather than delivering tangible solutions.
