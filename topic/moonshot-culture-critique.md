# Moonshot Culture Critique

## Content
The essay examines the moonshot approach popularized by Google's X, which focuses on solving seemingly impossible problems with massive resource investment to achieve exponential 10x impact. While the moonshot framework has inspired widespread adoption across tech companies, VCs, and incubators, the author argues that this approach has largely failed to deliver meaningful solutions to world problems, instead producing primarily marketing success and inspirational narratives. The piece critiques how the moonshot model has been co-opted and diluted by 'counterfeit moon shooters' who copy the branding and rhetoric while abandoning the actual rigor and resources that made X's approach distinctive. This cultural phenomenon reflects deeper issues about how the tech industry pursues prestige and scale over practical problem-solving.
