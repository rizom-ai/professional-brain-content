The essay critiques the moonshot philosophy popularized by Google's X division, which focuses on solving seemingly impossible problems with massive resource investment. While X's approach aims for 10x impact and exponential returns, the author argues that despite a decade of effort, the world's biggest problems remain largely unsolved, even as the moonshot model has inspired numerous imitators. The critique reveals that most copycat moonshot factories have simplified and distorted the original formula, focusing on fashionable problems and securing funding rather than producing meaningful solutions. This represents a fundamental disconnect between the marketing narrative of transformative innovation and the actual real-world impact of these ventures.
