# Moonshot Culture Critique

## Content
The piece examines the moonshot philosophy popularized by Google's X division, which promises 10x impact through massive resource investment in nearly impossible problems. The author traces this concept back to Kennedy's Apollo program and analyzes how X transformed it into a supposedly reproducible formula: identify unsolvable problems, spend enormous amounts of money, and sell solutions. However, the critical observation is that despite a decade of moonshot initiatives producing impressive marketing materials and media coverage, the world's biggest problems remain largely unsolved. The essay reveals a fundamental flaw in the approach: the formula itself has become more valuable than actual results, creating a culture where the appearance of ambitious problem-solving matters more than tangible progress.
