# Radical Automation

## Content
Radical automation is presented as a core principle for tackling low-hanging fruit in AI implementation—automating every laborious and boring chore that can be automated to prevent talent waste. The approach recognizes that most AI initiatives focus on moonshots with uncertain outcomes, while ignoring solvable problems that create immediate friction in teams. By automating information management tasks like synchronizing knowledge after absence, generating onboarding materials, and processing shared content, organizations can free up human attention for higher-value work. The practical examples (Synchronize, Onboarding, Research) demonstrate how this principle translates into concrete features that address genuine pain points in team collaboration and knowledge management.
