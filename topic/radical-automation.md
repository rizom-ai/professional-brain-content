# Radical Automation

## Content
Radical automation is presented as a core principle for identifying where AI can add immediate value by eliminating laborious and boring chores that can be systematically automated. The approach recognizes that every missed automation opportunity results in talent waste—highly skilled team members spending time on repetitive, non-creative work that machines can handle. Within Rizom's context, radical automation is paired with a 'human in the loop' philosophy, particularly effective in collaborative messaging apps where AI can operate in continuous feedback loops with users. This creates a practical framework where automation handles the tedious work while humans focus on judgment calls and creative problem-solving.
