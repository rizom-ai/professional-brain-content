## Content
Radical Automation is a foundational principle that drives the design of narrow AI systems. The core premise is that every laborious and boring chore that can be automated should be automated, as any missed opportunity inevitably results in talent waste. This philosophy reframes automation not as job displacement but as human resource optimization—freeing skilled workers from tedious tasks to focus on higher-value work. In the context of knowledge infrastructure, radical automation applies to routine information management tasks: filtering and summarizing message history to prevent information overload, extracting and organizing tacit knowledge for onboarding, processing and categorizing shared links that would otherwise go unread. The approach acknowledges that while automation isn't always successful, the deliberate pursuit of automating solvable problems represents a more pragmatic strategy than pursuing moonshot AI initiatives. Implementation requires identifying specific problems, understanding existing workflows and patterns, projecting desired outcomes, and determining appropriate data sources and methods for automation.
