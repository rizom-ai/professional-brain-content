# Narrow AI Applications

## Content
The content presents a strategic case for building many specialized, single-purpose AI systems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence moonshots. Narrow AI systems are designed to handle specific, limited tasks with high efficiency. The approach recognizes that while general AI remains largely theoretical, narrow AI can solve immediate real-world problems effectively. Examples include information management, message summarization, and knowledge extraction. This philosophy underpins Rizom's design: multiple focused AI components working in concert to handle distinct challenges like message synchronization, onboarding, and research organization. The key insight is that combining many narrow AIs often outperforms attempts to build one superintelligent system.
