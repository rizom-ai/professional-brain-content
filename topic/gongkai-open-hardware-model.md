# Gongkai Open Hardware Model

## Content
Gongkai represents a Chinese approach to open hardware that fundamentally differs from Western open source practices. Rather than attributing innovation to individual inventors and paying royalties, gongkai operates on a network view of intellectual property where designs, blueprints, and bills of materials are freely shared as favors within the ecosystem. This practice enables hardware hackers to access current components and iterate rapidly without being forced to use outdated technology or resort to reverse engineering. The Shenzhen shanzhai ecosystem exemplifies gongkai's power, creating a vibrant collaborative environment where manufacturers collectively contribute to rapid innovation and market adaptation. Bunnie Huang argues that gongkai is superior to Western open source for hardware development because it acknowledges that innovation builds on shared knowledge and encourages continuous improvement through transparent sharing.
