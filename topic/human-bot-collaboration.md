# Human-Bot Collaboration

## Content
The post explores a fundamental shift in how we think about collaborative work by proposing that agency and effective contribution matter more than whether team members are human or artificial. Through the Planet B thought experiment—a remote mission to colonize a habitable planet—Yeehaa examines what happens when human team members work alongside bots designed to contribute meaningfully to shared goals. This perspective challenges traditional assumptions about collaboration by asking whether humanness remains relevant if artificial agents can effectively advance mission objectives. The framework moves beyond anthropocentric thinking to focus on what actually enables teams to succeed: the quality and reliability of contributions from any agent, regardless of their nature.
