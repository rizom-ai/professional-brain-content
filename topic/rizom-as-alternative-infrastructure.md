# Rizom as Alternative Infrastructure

## Content
Rizom represents a concrete instantiation of distributed intelligence through open protocols, decentralized knowledge systems, and algorithmic trust mechanisms. The infrastructure combines personal knowledge brains that evolve like Git repositories, outcome-based certification that enables trust without gatekeepers, and open standards (HTTP, MCP, ACP) that prevent platform lock-in. A franchise model with equity stakes ensures that individuals own what they build within the ecosystem. This approach transforms the relationship between humans and machines from passive consumption to active collaboration, enabling knowledge to flow freely while preserving ownership and creating conditions for collective intelligence to emerge from individual autonomy.
