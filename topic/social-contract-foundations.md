# Social Contract Foundations

## Content
The article argues that institutional legitimacy is not derived from constitutional frameworks themselves, but from underlying social contracts—the shared, aligned values that citizens collectively subscribe to. COVID-19 served as a watershed moment revealing that constitutions function more as a suspension of disbelief than as true protections against authoritarianism. The author contends that institutions are only recognized as legitimate when serving particular interests, and are easily dismissed otherwise. The true bedrock of a healthy state is not its institutional structures but the functioning social contract that underpins them. This fundamental insight shifts the focus from institutional repair to the deeper work of rebuilding shared values and collective commitments that can sustain democratic systems through periods of division.
