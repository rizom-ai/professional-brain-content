# Nature as Waste System

## Summary
Shraddha Borawake's Garb-Age practice reveals that waste is intrinsic to both nature and culture, not external to them. This reframes nature as dispersed, fragmented, and abundant—challenging notions of purity and the nature-culture dichotomy.

Shraddha Borawake's visionary practice Garb-Age follows Bataille's footsteps by shifting the gaze towards waste that life produces, constantly blurring lines between nature, culture, and trash. Tourist memorabilia are framed as high art, throwaway lenses depicted as precious jewels, and garbage shapes landscapes as breathtaking as romantic paintings. Borawake's work reveals that waste is not external to nature and culture but intrinsic to both. This challenges conventional understanding suggesting nature and culture are discrete, pure entities rather than interconnected, complex systems. Just as waste permeates nature and culture, the logic of garbage—fragmentation, dispersion, and excess—is equally present in these domains. This perspective invites reconsideration of purity and authenticity, not only in cultural contexts (where we've learned to be critical following Holocaust atrocities) but also in nature, which has largely escaped such scrutiny. The work extends critical lens to the natural world, dismantling the idea of nature as universal and unified. Instead, nature is presented as mirroring waste's characteristics: dispersed, fragmented, and abundant. This conceptualization aligns with broader themes of decentralization and excess. By embracing this perspective, we move beyond traditional dichotomies of nature versus culture or purity versus waste, recognizing inherent abundance and excess in all aspects of our world.
