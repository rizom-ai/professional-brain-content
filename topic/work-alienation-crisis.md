# Work Alienation Crisis

## Content
The piece identifies a systemic crisis where work has become disconnected from purpose, meaning, and human flourishing. People experience burnout despite pursuing supposedly meaningful careers, trapped in performative busyness and defensive hierarchies that prioritize process over impact. This alienation stems from industrial-era organizational frameworks applied to post-industrial contexts, creating contradictions between what we teach our children about passion and purpose versus the reality of meaningless meetings and permission-seeking. The author argues this is not individual failure but systemic misalignment, manifesting in talent waste, mass resignations, and the psychological cost of postponing authentic work.
