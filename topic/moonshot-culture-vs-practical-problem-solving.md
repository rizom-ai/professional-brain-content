# Moonshot Culture vs Practical Problem-Solving

## Summary
The piece critiques the pervasive 'moonshot' mentality popularized by Google's X division, where massive resources chase exponential, world-changing solutions. It contrasts this with a pragmatic alternative approach focused on solving small, everyday problems with minimal resources and technology.

## Content
The article examines Google's X division, which was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin under Astro Teller to pursue 'moonshots'—projects with 10x potential impact. The moonshot formula consists of three steps: focus on an unsolvable problem, spend massive amounts of money, and sell the solution. While X has generated significant marketing buzz and inspired numerous imitators, the actual impact on world problems remains questionable. Many agencies, incubators, and VC firms have become 'counterfeit moon shooters,' copying X's marketing approach but modifying the formula to focus on fashionable problems rather than genuinely unsolvable ones, and seeking outrageous funding rather than solving problems. The article critiques this trend as ego-driven and disconnected from actual impact. In contrast, the alternative philosophy embraces 'low-end theory'—consciously avoiding moonshot ambitions in favor of solving small, practical everyday problems that matter to people. This approach prioritizes simplicity, using minimal technology and resources to address real friction points like employee onboarding, knowledge management, and information organization. The underlying conviction is that meaningful work comes from addressing genuine needs with humility and pragmatism, rather than chasing exponential returns and public glory.
