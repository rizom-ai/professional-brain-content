# AI Winters as Design Inflection Points

## Content
The presentation reframes AI winters not as failures to be avoided, but as selection events that reveal what kinds of intelligence systems we're actually building. Historical AI winters selected against emergence and autonomy in favor of control and predictability—moving from bottom-up learning to rule-based systems, then from human reasoning to statistical scaling. Rather than viewing the next potential AI winter as a crisis, the presentation suggests it's an opportunity to fundamentally reconsider what intelligence means. Artists and practitioners like Casey Reas, Ian Cheng, and Pierre Huyghe have already demonstrated alternative approaches to intelligence that emphasize emergence, autonomy, and creative practice. The key question shifts from 'How do we build AGI?' to 'What practices do we enable?'—recognizing that intelligence is ultimately the practice of creating meaning.
