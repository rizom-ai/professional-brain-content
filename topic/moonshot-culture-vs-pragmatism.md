# Moonshot Culture vs Pragmatism

## Summary
The post critiques the widespread adoption of moonshot thinking—pursuing exponential, high-risk solutions to massive problems—as popularized by Google X, arguing that most organizations copy the approach without the resources to succeed. It contrasts this with a pragmatic alternative of solving everyday, low-impact problems with minimal resources and simple technology.

Google X, founded by Astro Teller, pioneered the 'moonshot factory' concept—investing only in ideas promising 10x impact, drawing inspiration from Kennedy's Apollo 11 mission. The moonshot formula consists of three steps: focus on an unsolvable problem, spend massive resources, and sell the solution. While Google X generated impressive marketing and cultural cache, its actual impact on solving world problems remains minimal. However, the moonshot approach has been widely copied by agencies, incubators, and VC firms in what the author calls 'counterfeit moon shooting.' These imitators modified the formula to: focus on fashionable problems and ask for outrageous amounts of money—removing the actual resource commitment and execution capability that made Google's approach theoretically viable. Entrepreneurs now pitch themselves as world-problem solvers seeking funding, often lacking humility about their actual capabilities. In contrast, the author argues for a 'low end theory' approach: consciously avoiding moonshot ambitions and instead solving small, everyday problems that others overlook—like onboarding struggles, link management, and catching up on missed messages. This pragmatic philosophy emphasizes solving real friction points with the simplest technology possible, one problem at a time, without ego or grandiose claims.
