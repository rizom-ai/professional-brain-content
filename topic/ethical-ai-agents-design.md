# Ethical AI Agents Design

## Summary
The design and development of collaborative AI agents that embody ethical principles, creative capabilities, and intelligent information processing. These agents are specifically architected to support distributed, asynchronous communities by automating complex tasks while respecting community values and fostering insight generation.

## Content
The core challenge addressed is designing tools for distributed, multi-disciplinary communities that lack shared space, time, language, and archival systems. Rather than creating autonomous systems that render humans obsolete, the approach focuses on ethical creative intelligence—agents that combine three key capabilities: intelligence (finding, aggregating, and condensing relevant information), creativity (combining information in ways that generate new insights), and ethics (respecting, guarding, and when necessary questioning community values). The solution architecture uses a state machine model where bots progress through consecutive states: Acquire (gathering data from chat streams or external sources), Clean (removing irrelevant/sensitive data and translating to domain models), Analyze (transforming into recommendations and aggregations), Evaluate (determining if data is ready or needs reprocessing), and Present (displaying information in various formats). This design allows bots to compensate for the limitations of stream-based communication by providing context, augmentations, and archives. The system also incorporates cassettes—reusable single-purpose functions that lower the threshold for community members to contribute new features. Practical implementations include Tweet It (which acquires user data, cleans and analyzes tweets to recommend relevant hashtags) and The Cartographer (which listens to chat streams, fetches and analyzes shared links to visualize the community's online ecosystem). The governance model uses a health score system where both human and bot community members receive scores based on their ethical and creative contributions.
