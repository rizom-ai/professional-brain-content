# Bot State Machine Architecture

## Content
The bot state machine is a foundational architectural pattern that structures autonomous agents through five consecutive but non-linear states: Acquire (gathering data), Clean (filtering and translating), Analyze (transforming into insights), Evaluate (quality assessment), and Present (output generation). This design allows bots to handle complex workflows while maintaining flexibility to loop back through states as needed, ensuring data quality and relevance throughout the process. The state machine approach makes bot behavior predictable and debuggable while supporting diverse use cases, from social media optimization to knowledge mapping, demonstrating how structured workflows can power intelligent automation without sacrificing ethical considerations or community-specific requirements.
