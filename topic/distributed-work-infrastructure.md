# Distributed Work Infrastructure

## Summary
Examines the technical and conceptual infrastructure needed to support collaboration among team members who may never be in the same physical location. This involves rethinking how teams organize, communicate, and achieve goals when geographic dispersion is the default condition.

## Content
The challenge of building a community of people that may never be in the same place at the same time requires fundamentally rethinking collaborative infrastructure. Planet B uses a planetary colonization scenario as a thought experiment to explore how distributed teams operate effectively. The infrastructure must support continuous collaboration across time zones and geographic boundaries, necessitating systems that don't rely on synchronous in-person interaction. This includes both technical systems for communication and coordination, as well as organizational structures that accommodate asynchronous work patterns. The solution proposed involves augmenting human team members with artificial agents that can operate continuously, filling gaps in availability and capability. The infrastructure must also handle the complexity of bot-to-bot communication alongside human-bot and human-human interactions. This distributed work model raises questions about team cohesion, shared purpose, and how to maintain alignment when team members (human and artificial) operate across different temporal and geographic contexts.
