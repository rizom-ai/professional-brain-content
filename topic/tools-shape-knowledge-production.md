# Tools Shape Knowledge Production

## Content
The post argues that humanities scholars fundamentally misunderstand the role of tools in research and teaching. Rather than viewing tools as neutral containers for content, the author demonstrates how inappropriate tools actively constrain how we think, teach, and produce knowledge. Word processors designed for office work, proprietary enterprise applications, and disconnected teaching platforms fail to meet the specific needs of academic practice. The author emphasizes that twentieth-century theory should have taught us to focus on the structures that produce knowledge, yet humanities scholars selectively ignore this insight. By using generic tools designed for other purposes, scholars reduce complex intellectual problems to whatever their inadequate tools can handle, much like someone with only a hammer seeing every problem as a nail.
