# Surveillance Capitalism & Digital Control

## Summary
The article examines surveillance capitalism as a system that weaponizes behavioral data to control human behavior, highlighting how corporations and governments have aligned interests in extracting and exploiting personal data. It argues that naive expansion of internet access without proper safeguards only reinforces this exploitative cycle.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as articulated by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments, despite being former adversaries, now share a common interest in connecting the unconnected to gather larger amounts of granular data. By analyzing vast behavioral patterns, they can predict and preempt people's actions, effectively controlling behavior. The article emphasizes that simply providing more internet access without addressing alignment issues only feeds this vicious cycle of exploitation. The internet became fragmented not due to technical limitations but because people outsourced responsibility for maintaining it to governments and corporations. This outsourcing of care represents a fundamental loss of ownership and agency over digital spaces that were originally promised to be decentralized and user-controlled.
