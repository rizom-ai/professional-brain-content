# Surveillance Capitalism & Digital Control

## Summary
The article examines how surveillance capitalism weaponizes behavioral data to control human actions, with corporations and governments collaborating to exploit digital access. It argues that naive expansion of internet connectivity without alignment of values only feeds this cycle of exploitation and predetermined dystopias.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as defined by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments share a common interest in connecting the unconnected to gather larger amounts of granular data, allowing them to predict and preempt people's actions. The internet has become fragmented not due to technical reasons but because responsibility for its stewardship was outsourced to these powerful entities. Naively providing better internet access without first establishing alignment of values only perpetuates the cycle of behavioral manipulation and control. The article warns that without swift intervention, humanity faces a predetermined future already being written by those with vested interests in surveillance and behavioral prediction.
