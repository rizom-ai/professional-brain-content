# Shenzhen Innovation Culture

## Summary
A reference to the Chinese manufacturing and design ethos of iterative copying and feature modification as a legitimate form of innovation. The article uses Shenzhen fashion as a metaphor for how the tech industry counterfeit moonshot factories remake existing formulas by adding features and removing others.

## Content
The article invokes 'true Shenzhen fashion' to describe how counterfeit moonshot factories modify Google X's original formula. Rather than wholesale copying, they make small but significant changes: removing the discipline of truly unsolvable problems and the massive resource commitment, while adding fashionable problem framing and outrageous funding requests. This reference acknowledges Shenzhen's culture of iterative design and manufacturing where copying with modifications is a recognized practice. The metaphor suggests that in tech culture, as in Shenzhen manufacturing, remixing existing models through strategic additions and subtractions is a standard operating procedure. This approach differs from pure innovation or pure imitation—it's a pragmatic recombination of existing elements tailored to local market conditions and constraints.
