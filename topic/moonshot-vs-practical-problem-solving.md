# Moonshot vs. Practical Problem-Solving

## Summary
This article contrasts Google X's moonshot factory approach—focusing on solving exponential, nearly impossible problems with massive resources—against a pragmatic alternative of addressing low-hanging fruit with minimal, simple solutions. It critiques the proliferation of counterfeit moonshot ventures that copy the branding without the resources or genuine impact, while advocating for humble, incremental improvements to everyday problems.

Google X, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin through Astro Teller, operates on a moonshot philosophy rooted in exponential thinking—investing only in ideas with 10x potential impact. The term 'moonshot' references JFK's Apollo program, which cost $150 billion in today's dollars to land humans on the moon. X's three-step formula: focus on unsolvable problems, spend massive resources, and sell solutions. However, over a decade later, X has generated more inspiring marketing than actual world-changing solutions. The article criticizes copycat moonshot factories—agencies, incubators, and VC firms—that adopted X's marketing but modified the formula to: focus on fashionable problems and ask for outrageous amounts of money. These counterfeit moon shooters claim to solve cancer, famine, and poverty but lack genuine commitment or resources. In contrast, the low-end theory rejects ego-driven moonshots in favor of solving everyday practical problems: onboarding new employees, organizing shared links, summarizing missed messages. This approach prioritizes simplicity, humility, and tangible impact over prestige. The philosophy emphasizes that small improvements to daily work can be more meaningful than chasing impossible grand visions. The low-hanging fruit approach solves real problems one at a time using minimal, straightforward technology.
