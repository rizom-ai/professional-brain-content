# Data and Knowledge Production

## Summary
This topic explores the fundamental shift in how data shapes modern scientific inquiry and knowledge creation. It examines the tension between data-driven realism and humanistic interpretation, questioning how computation and big data are transforming academic research, representation, and the relationship between theory and empirical evidence.

## Content
The content discusses how modern science and technology increasingly rest on computation and data, drawing from Heidegger's philosophical warnings about the uncontrollable shadow cast by complex calculations. It contrasts Heidegger's nuanced view with Chris Anderson's 'End of Science' declaration, which posits that big data provides direct, unmediated knowledge of reality, eliminating the need for theories and models. The discussion critiques digital humanities for merely applying data as new tools within existing frameworks rather than recognizing data's creative and transformative potential. The research group proposes moving beyond traditional humanistic interpretation toward actionable knowledge, acknowledging that computer technology has rendered the opposition between thinking and action invalid. Key questions raised include: Who are the agents of big data? What verbs express the current relation between science and data? How can commercial and academic uses of datasets inform each other? The manifesto positions data's shadow not as a threat but as an opportunity for the humanities to engage with knowledge production in fundamentally new ways.
