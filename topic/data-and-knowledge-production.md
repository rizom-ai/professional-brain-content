# Data and Knowledge Production

## Summary
Explores how data fundamentally reshapes knowledge production, scientific methodology, and the humanities in the digital age. The discussion examines the philosophical implications of data-driven approaches, moving beyond traditional interpretive frameworks toward new forms of actionable knowledge and engagement with data.

## Content
The content traces the evolution of data's role in science from Heidegger's 1938 critique of computation to Chris Anderson's 2009 'End of Science' declaration. Heidegger argued that modern science rests on computation but warned of an uncontrollable shadow accompanying complex calculations—a shadow that announces a new era rather than mere loss. Anderson's big data thesis claims data provides direct, unmediated knowledge of reality, replacing theories and models. However, the research group challenges both Heidegger's contemplative response and Anderson's naive realism. Digital humanities have largely reaffirmed humanist heritage through data rather than embracing data's creative potential. The Data Drive research group proposes reintroducing Heidegger's concept of the 'gigantic' (where quantitative becomes qualitative) as an opportunity rather than threat. Drawing on Kittler's argument that computing has rendered the thinking/action opposition invalid, the group advocates for moving beyond contemplation toward actionable knowledge. The manifesto identifies key questions: Who are the agents of big data? How are the humanities transforming beyond interpretation? What verbs express the current science-data relationship? How can commercial and academic uses of data inform each other? Data now drives representation, manipulation, and knowledge production across all domains, requiring new frameworks that blend academic rigor with commercial innovation.
