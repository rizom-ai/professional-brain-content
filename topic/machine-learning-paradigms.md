# Machine Learning Paradigms

## Summary
The post explores the fundamental distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning, arguing that unsupervised learning represents a paradigm shift in how we understand intelligence itself. It challenges the human tendency to rely on established baselines and advocates for embracing algorithmic discoveries that may contradict human intuition and beliefs.

## Content
Supervised learning relies on human-defined baselines, where models are trained on labeled datasets with known answers. The feedback loop between training data and loss functions ensures the model learns from human guidance, but fundamentally cannot exceed what it has been taught. Unsupervised learning, by contrast, operates without predefined human baselines. It discovers patterns and clusters in data based on mathematical proximity and relationships invisible to human cognition. The post uses clustering as a primary example, showing how unsupervised learning can identify customer segments more effectively than human-created personas. The core argument is that humans must overcome their reluctance to accept algorithmic superiority and allow machines to explore intelligence beyond human-defined parameters. This represents a fundamental shift in thinking about AI—not as a tool to replicate human intelligence, but as a means to discover entirely new forms of intelligence. The post emphasizes that dropping the human baseline is not about machines replacing human intelligence, but rather expanding the possibilities of what intelligence can be. It draws parallels to music production, where technical fidelity constraints were eventually transcended to unlock creative possibilities.
