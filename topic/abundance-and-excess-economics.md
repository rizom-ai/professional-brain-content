# Abundance and Excess Economics

## Summary
This topic explores a paradigm shift from scarcity-driven capitalism to an economy of excess and abundance, drawing on philosophical frameworks by Bataille and contemporary artistic practices. It examines how embracing waste and excess as inherent to nature and culture challenges traditional economic assumptions and opens new possibilities for understanding resource management and societal values.

## Content
The article challenges the dominant scarcity-based organizing principle of modern capitalism by examining Georges Bataille's philosophy of excess and expenditure. Bataille's economy of excess, articulated in works like 'The Notion of Expenditure' and 'The Accursed Share,' proposes that waste should be embraced rather than discarded with shame. This perspective affirms that the world contains far too much rather than too little energy, as evidenced by solar radiation and life's chemical surpluses. The abundance mindset differs fundamentally from the excess mindset: while abundance focuses on efficiency, excess celebrates the non-utilitarian, symbolic, and psychological dimensions of human experience. The article traces how technical innovation has been driven by a '10x mindset' seeking inexhaustible resources, which paradoxically threatens capitalism itself since scarcity is its organizing principle. Contemporary artist Shraddha Borawake's 'Garb-Age' practice demonstrates this philosophy in action, reframing garbage as intrinsic to both nature and culture rather than external waste. Her work reveals that waste is not separate from these realms but fundamentally interconnected with them, challenging notions of purity and authenticity. The article argues that recognizing waste and excess as inherent to nature, culture, and technological systems invites a paradigm shift in how we approach environmental issues, resource management, and digital ecosystems. This perspective moves beyond traditional dichotomies of nature versus culture and purity versus waste, fostering a more nuanced understanding of our interconnected existence. The conclusion positions economies of garbage not merely as waste management but as a fundamental reorientation toward abundance consciousness.
