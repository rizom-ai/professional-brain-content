# Surveillance Capitalism and Digital Control

## Summary
The article examines how surveillance capitalism weaponizes behavioral data to control people's actions and shape predetermined futures. It explores the dangers of corporations and governments collecting vast amounts of personal data and the need to resist this system through intentional design of alternative futures.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as defined by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments share a vested interest in connecting more people online to gather larger amounts of granular behavioral data, which they use to predict and preempt human actions. The article argues that naively giving people more internet access only feeds into this cycle of exploitation. The key danger is that without intervention, we are destined for a future already being written for us by powerful interests. To counter this, the author advocates for alignment before connection—understanding what people need and presenting them with multiple viable alternatives rather than a single predetermined narrative. The article emphasizes that whenever new technologies (cryptocurrencies, AI, VR/AR) are presented as inevitable futures, we must critically examine who is promoting them and what interests they serve. This requires reading past futurisms and counter-narratives to reject the logic of futures imposed upon us.
