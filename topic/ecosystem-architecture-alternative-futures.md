# Ecosystem Architecture & Alternative Futures

## Summary
The article proposes ecosystem architecture as a practice for designing multiple inhabitable futures based on shared values, rejecting predetermined dystopian narratives. It emphasizes the importance of alignment before connection, learning from past futurisms, and creating alternatives that allow people to choose between different possible worlds rather than accepting a single inevitable outcome.

## Content
Ecosystem architecture encourages investment in futures we would like to inhabit rather than accepting the one expected to become reality. The true promise of the decentralized internet was the multiplication of public and private spaces with unrivaled ownership. To prevent further fragmentation and control, alignment must precede connection—this means understanding what people need, shaping tangible futures from those needs, and offering genuine alternatives. Without a proper palette of alternatives, people repeat the most probable outcome, which typically reinforces the status quo. The article advocates questioning who presents inevitable futures and what interests they serve. Learning from past futurisms, like Afrofuturism, helps us reject predetermined narratives and imagine better alternatives. Multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values can peacefully coexist, but they require deliberate design, development, and nurturing. This practice of ecosystem architecture is essential to reclaim agency over our collective future.
