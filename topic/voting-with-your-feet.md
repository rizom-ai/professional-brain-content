# Voting with Your Feet

## Content
Voting with your feet is a fundamental principle of healthy ecosystems that enables freedom of movement and exit. Drawing from natural systems where organisms migrate in response to environmental conditions, this concept applies to digital and organizational ecosystems where members can freely choose to leave and join other communities. The freedom to exit is not merely an individual right but a necessary mechanism for ecosystem health, preventing entrapment and fostering innovation through the possibility of imagining alternative habitats. This principle challenges monolithic, universal systems by affirming value pluralism—the recognition that no single ecosystem can or should serve all people. Healthy ecosystems should actively encourage this freedom rather than restrict it, as forced containment signals fundamental moral failures in the ecosystem's foundational values.
