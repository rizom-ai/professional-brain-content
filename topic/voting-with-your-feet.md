# Voting with Your Feet

## Summary
The principle that healthy ecosystems must enable members to freely exit and migrate to other communities based on changing conditions or misalignment of values. This freedom to leave is presented as a fundamental characteristic of regenerative systems, preventing entrapment and enabling innovation.

## Content
Voting with your feet is a concept borrowed from nature where organisms migrate in response to environmental conditions like food availability, climate, or habitat quality. In the context of digital ecosystems, this principle means members should have the freedom to leave a community if it no longer serves their needs or values. Milton Friedman's famous phrase 'People vote with their feet' encapsulates this idea. The ability to switch habitats is a decisive argument against fragmentation being purely loss—it's an affordance that monolithic wholes cannot offer due to their inherent universality. Healthy ecosystems facilitate this possibility as a necessary condition for creativity and innovation, since imagination demands the possibility of another habitat. Forceful entrapment, whether physical or ideological, should be treated as an alarming signal of fundamental flaws in an ecosystem's moral proposition. Communities built around strong shared values don't need to hold onto members who don't subscribe to them; rather, they should encourage people to imagine and build new spaces.
