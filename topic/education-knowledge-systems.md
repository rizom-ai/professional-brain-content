# Education & Knowledge Systems

## Summary
Yeehaa's work spans reimagining education and building knowledge systems that enable genuine learning and growth outside traditional institutional constraints. This includes both practical experience with bootcamps and technology, and broader philosophical inquiry into how communities and knowledge-sharing spaces can be structured to foster human development.

## Content
Yeehaa's journey includes creating Offcourse, an open source learning platform designed to reimagine education outside institutional walls. Through work with bootcamps and education technology, direct experience revealed how difficult it is to create spaces where people can actually grow. Each educational project provided insights into what makes communities thrive or collapse. This foundational understanding informs the current work on Rizom, an ecosystem of tools helping individuals and organizations create, connect, and share knowledge. The underlying philosophy recognizes that knowledge systems and educational structures need to fundamentally shift from institutional models to enable authentic community learning and development.
