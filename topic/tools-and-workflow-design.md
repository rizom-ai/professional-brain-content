# Tools and Workflow Design

## Summary
The essay argues that humanities scholars inadequately address the tools and workflows that shape their research and teaching practices. It contends that appropriate tool selection and design is fundamental to advancing scholarly practice, and that the discipline's reluctance to engage with digital tools perpetuates inefficiencies and missed opportunities for innovation.

## Content
The author discusses how humanities scholars lack awareness of the digital tools they use for research and teaching, treating software as a blind spot rather than a critical component of their practice. Current tools are poorly suited to scholarly needs: word processors lack semantic markup and citation management, online teaching platforms merely mimic classroom settings without enhancing learning, and research and teaching tools remain disconnected despite calls for integration. The essay contrasts this with software development culture, where programmers actively shape their work environment through deliberate tool selection, community dialogue, and continuous improvement. The author argues that the humanities fail to recognize twentieth-century theory emphasizing that structures of knowledge production matter as much as content itself. By refusing to engage with tool design, scholars reduce complex problems to simplistic solutions—treating all problems as nails to be hammered. The essay positions deliberate tool use as the distinguishing factor between craftsmanship and unskilled labor, arguing that appropriate tools increase efficiency, enable differentiation between problem types, and unlock solutions to previously undiscovered challenges. This insight motivates the Coding the Humanities initiative, which seeks to shift the discipline's focus from content alone to the practices and tools that generate knowledge.
