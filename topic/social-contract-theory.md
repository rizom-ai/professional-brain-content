# Social Contract Theory

## Content
The article argues that functioning social contracts, not institutions themselves, are the true foundation of healthy democracies. The author contends that constitutions and formal institutions have historically served as a "suspension of disbelief" rather than genuine safeguards against authoritarianism or democratic decay. The COVID pandemic demonstrated this reality when citizens willingly abandoned constitutional protections, revealing that institutional legitimacy depends entirely on whether they serve particular interests. The author proposes that rebuilding civil societies requires establishing renewed social contracts grounded in aligned values and shared commitments. These social contracts must balance individual rights with collective responsibilities and undergo constant debate and negotiation to remain functional and relevant.
