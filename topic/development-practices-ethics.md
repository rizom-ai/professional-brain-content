# Development Practices & Ethics

## Summary
The article traces the evolution from Test Driven Development through Behavior Driven Development to Value Driven Development, examining how each methodology progressively makes implicit values and ethical commitments explicit and measurable in software engineering.

## Content
Test Driven Development (TDD) introduces the practice of writing tests before code, formalizing expectations and creating contracts between developers and their future work. This approach fundamentally shifts how developers think about their responsibilities. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) extends TDD by shifting focus from code to users, using domain-specific languages like Gherkin to facilitate dialogue between engineers and end-users, creating contracts about mutual expectations rather than just technical specifications. Value Driven Development builds on BDD by making explicit the values that drive software development decisions, particularly the 'In order to' clause that articulates why software is being built. The article argues that most software developers are value-driven and want to make positive impact, but these values remain implicit and invisible to users. Public Badges are proposed as a mechanism to render these implicit values explicit, measurable, and communicable, allowing users to choose software aligned with their own values. The progression from TDD to VDD represents an evolution in how the software industry can address ethics not through top-down mandates but through transparent, reproducible practices that make values visible and accountable.
