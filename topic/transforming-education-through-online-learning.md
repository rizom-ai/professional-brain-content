# Transforming Education Through Online Learning

## Summary
An exploration of how online education can fundamentally improve higher education quality rather than serve as a mere substitute for traditional classroom instruction. The author reflects on a 2013 proposal to integrate online learning into university curricula and examines why innovative online platforms like Code School succeeded by embracing digital-native pedagogical approaches rather than replicating classroom experiences.

## Content
In 2013, the author and Marijn Koolen proposed that the University of Amsterdam invest in online education—not primarily as a cost-saving measure or response to institutional threats, but as an opportunity to increase educational quality. However, the proposal failed to gain traction, and by 2020, most institutions still treat online learning as a second-best alternative to in-person instruction. The author reflects on why their argument was ineffective: they shared conclusions without conveying the journey or enthusiasm behind their vision. The turning point came from studying Code School, a now-defunct online coding platform that succeeded by inverting traditional assumptions about online education. Code School demonstrated three key principles: (1) Online is not a Compromise—instead of recreating classroom vibes, they created lessons of 5-10 minutes optimized for digital delivery, treating online as a distinct medium with unique advantages; (2) Automation is your Friend—using in-browser editors, real-time feedback through unit tests, and intelligent hints eliminated the need for human intervention while maintaining engagement; (3) Learning should be Fun—through creative theming, gamification, and memorable elements like course theme songs that embedded learning content, they made education inherently enjoyable. The author regrets not emphasizing passion and vision in the original proposal, recognizing that effective advocacy requires helping others see the potential rather than positioning oneself as an expert delivering solutions. The 2020 pandemic made this failure more apparent, as educators defaulted to Zoom lectures rather than reimagining what online education could offer.
