# Moonshot Methodology

## Summary
An examination of Google X's moonshot factory approach and its widespread adoption across the tech industry. The article critiques how the original 10x impact formula has been diluted into superficial imitations that prioritize marketing over actual problem-solving.

## Content
Google X, led by Astro Teller, pioneered the moonshot factory concept—investing in ideas with 10x potential impact over status quo. The original three-step formula: (1) Focus on an unsolvable problem, (2) Spend significant resources on it, (3) Sell the resulting solution. Inspired by Kennedy's Apollo 11 moon landing program ($25.4 billion in 1960s dollars, $150 billion adjusted), X positioned itself as a mass-producer of nearly impossible solutions. However, the article argues that over a decade, X has produced more inspiring marketing than actual world-changing solutions. The methodology has spawned numerous imitators—'counterfeit moon shooters' in agencies, incubators, and VC firms—who have modified the formula to: (1) Focus on a fashionable problem, (2) Ask for outrageous amounts of money. These copycats prioritize ego and publicity over genuine problem-solving, with entrepreneurs pitching themselves as world-saviors capable of curing cancer and ending poverty if given sufficient funding.
