# Values-Driven Software Development

## Summary
The article explores how software development practices can be designed to make ethical values explicit and measurable. It builds on Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodologies to propose Value Driven Development, where developers and users collaboratively define and formalize the values that drive their software projects.

## Content
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a foundational practice where developers write tests before code, creating contracts that formalize expectations about what code should do. This represents an ethical approach by establishing clear promises about functionality. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) extends TDD by shifting focus from code to users, using domain-specific languages like Gherkin to create specifications that facilitate dialogue between engineers and users, managing mutual expectations. Value Driven Development further advances this paradigm by emphasizing the 'In order to' clause in specifications—the actual values and goals behind software creation. Rather than limiting specifications to functional requirements or user stories, Value Driven Development encourages developers to explicitly state what values they are committed to: accessibility, privacy protection, happiness, sustainability, or other ethical considerations. By making these values measurable, reproducible, and communicable through Public Badges and similar mechanisms, developers can demonstrate their ethical commitments to customers, partners, and end users. This approach recognizes that most software developers want to create positive impact but struggle to communicate their values externally. The practice transforms implicit ethical intentions into explicit, verifiable commitments that allow stakeholders to choose solutions aligned with their own values.
