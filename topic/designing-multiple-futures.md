# Designing Multiple Futures

## Summary
The article explores how to imagine and construct alternative futures beyond predetermined narratives, drawing on Afrofuturism and critical theory to challenge linear progress and technological inevitability. It emphasizes the importance of questioning who presents future visions and designing multiple coexisting ecosystems based on shared values.

## Content
The article argues against accepting supposedly inevitable futures, particularly in emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. Critical questions must be asked: Who is presenting this future? How is this person or organization situated? What interests do they have in its realization? This skepticism applies equally to past futurisms, which Kodwo Eshun describes as counter-futures that create temporal complications and disturb linear progress narratives. Past futurists serve as allies in rejecting predetermined futures and can teach us to imagine alternatives. The key distinction in our current moment is that we no longer need to accept one-size-fits-all models of the future. Multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values can peacefully coexist without fragmentation. However, these alternatives will not emerge spontaneously—they must be deliberately designed, developed, and nurtured through ecosystem architecture. The practice involves actively shaping tangible futures from identified needs and presenting people with genuine choices rather than allowing the most probable outcome (which reinforces status quo) to dominate.
