# Institutional Legitimacy and Social Contracts

## Summary
Institutions do not inherently protect democracy; rather, functioning social contracts built on shared, aligned values form the true foundation of democratic societies. The COVID pandemic revealed that constitutions are merely symbolic agreements that collapse when citizens prioritize particular interests, demonstrating that institutional legitimacy depends entirely on collective buy-in to foundational values rather than formal legal structures.

## Content
The article challenges the conventional belief that public institutions and constitutions serve as primary safeguards against anti-democratic forces. The author argues that institutions are only recognized as legitimate when they serve particular interests and are easily dismissed when they don't, as evidenced by examples like Israel's disregard for UN resolutions without meaningful consequences. The COVID pandemic served as a watershed moment, revealing that people willingly abandoned constitutional protections when faced with competing priorities, demonstrating that the constitution functioned as mere 'suspension of disbelief' rather than genuine protection. The fundamental insight is that what truly protects democracies is not institutional frameworks but functioning social contracts—plural agreements rooted in shared, aligned values to which most citizens subscribe. Institutions are built upon these social contracts, and when the social contract breaks down, institutions lose legitimacy regardless of their formal authority. The author argues we cannot repair existing institutions without first rebuilding the underlying social contracts and renewed conversations about collective values and commitments. This requires moving beyond institutional reform to address the fundamental agreements that underpin democratic societies. The upcoming series proposes using decentralized and asynchronous tools available today to rebuild civil societies, but emphasizes that any technological foundation must rest on a solid bedrock of strong common values requiring constant debate and negotiation. The goal is to create constitutions that balance individual rights with shared responsibilities, with effective institutions always requiring a functioning social contract as their foundation.
