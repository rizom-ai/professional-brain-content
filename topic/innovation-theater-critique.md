# Innovation Theater Critique

## Content
The essay critiques how the moonshot narrative has been commodified and imitated by organizations seeking prestige and funding without genuine commitment to solving problems. These 'counterfeit moon shooters' adopt the marketing language and branding of Google X while removing the actual resource commitment and replacing unsolvable problems with fashionable ones. The piece uses the metaphor of Shenzhen manufacturing culture to describe how the original formula gets stripped down and repackaged for mass consumption. This critique reveals a broader pattern where innovation becomes a performance for investors and media rather than a serious attempt to address real challenges.
