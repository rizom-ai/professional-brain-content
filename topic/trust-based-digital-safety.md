# Trust-Based Digital Safety

## Summary
The post argues that security measures alone are insufficient for creating safe digital spaces, and instead advocates for building networks of trust as a more effective approach. It examines the paradox of how secure communication systems often undermine trust relations, and demonstrates through historical examples like spam filtering how trust-based solutions outperform purely security-focused approaches.

The fundamental challenge in digital spaces is the tension between security and trust. While code was originally invented to enable secure communication despite suspicion (as traced back to Roman encrypted messages), the internet has invested heavily in security measures while neglecting trust-building. This creates a paradox: secure systems often erode trust relations rather than strengthen them. The history of spam filtering illustrates this perfectly. Early approaches relied on blacklists and domain filtering to block suspicious emails, but these failed because spammers adapted with spoofing techniques. The breakthrough came when ISPs shifted to reputation lists and whitelists—building networks of trusted partners rather than policing offenders. Similarly, anti-virus software followed the same pattern. The contemporary digital landscape shows widespread trust failures: consumers face Faustian tradeoffs between privacy and social participation, information sources are unreliable, and fact-checking has become impossible. The solution requires moving beyond purely algorithmic or anecdotal trust to evidence-based approaches. Public Badges represent a practical mechanism for organizations to collect and communicate evidence about their values, enabling sustainable safety built on demonstrated trustworthiness rather than security theater. This requires coalitions of actual people and organizations working together, not just technological solutions alone.
