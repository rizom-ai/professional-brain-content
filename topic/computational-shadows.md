# Computational Shadows

## Summary
Examines the hidden dimensions and uncontrollable aspects of computation and data systems, drawing from Heideggerian philosophy. The concept reframes technological shadow not as mere loss but as a manifest testimony that reveals new possibilities for knowledge and action.

## Content
Building on Heidegger's distinction between shadow as absence versus shadow as manifestation of light, the piece argues that the 'uncontrollable and all-encompassing shadow' of computation announces a new era rather than merely representing loss of control. While Anderson's 'End of Science' thesis treats data as transparent access to reality, the Data Drive manifesto recognizes that data systems have intrinsic shadows—concealed dimensions, unmapped territories, and emergent properties that cannot be fully controlled or predicted. These shadows are not problems to be eliminated but opportunities to be explored. The research group positions itself between naive technological optimism and pessimistic humanism, recognizing that the gigantic scale of computation produces qualitatively different phenomena. This philosophical stance informs their commitment to engaging with data's driving power and creative potential rather than attempting to subordinate it to pre-existing disciplinary frameworks.
