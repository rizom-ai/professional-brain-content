# Gongkai Hardware Design

## Content
Gongkai, meaning 'open or to make public,' is a progressive approach to intellectual property and hardware innovation originating from the Shenzhen shanzhai ecosystem. Unlike Western open source models, gongkai involves manufacturers freely sharing intricate hardware blueprints, design specifications, and bills of materials within a collaborative network. This practice creates a dynamic ecosystem where ideas and designs are traded as favors rather than protected by strict IP ownership, reflecting a 'network view' of innovation where creators build on the shoulders of others. Gongkai enables rapid iteration and innovation at scale while avoiding the constraints of reverse engineering or reliance on outdated components. The model demonstrates superior suitability for open hardware development compared to Western alternatives, fostering an expansive collaborative environment that accelerates technological advancement across the decentralized manufacturing landscape.
