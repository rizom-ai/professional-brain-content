# Narrow AI Systems Design

## Summary
The case for building specialized, single-purpose AI systems rather than pursuing general AI moonshots. This approach emphasizes practical automation of real-world problems through narrow AI combined with human-in-the-loop feedback, focusing on high-impact but achievable solutions.

## Content
The core argument is that general AI and moonshot initiatives have failed to deliver promised breakthroughs while ignoring solvable real-world problems. Narrow AI systems are designed to handle singular or limited tasks effectively. The proposed approach includes: Radical Automation—automating laborious and boring chores to prevent talent waste; Human In The Loop—using collaborative messaging apps to create continuous feedback loops between AI and users; Low-Hanging Fruit—deliberately tackling the 90% of achievable problems first rather than pursuing moonshots. Rizom exemplifies this philosophy as knowledge infrastructure that functions as a virtual coworker, moderating team communication, organizing valuable knowledge, and augmenting information across tools and teams. The AI stack uses spaCy and Compromise for NLP, TensorFlow.js for classification, custom rule engines, and integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams. Practical applications include: Synchronize (addressing information overload through rule-based filtering and NLP summarization of Trello boards, meeting notes, and message history); Onboarding (extracting tacit knowledge through context extraction and FAQ generation from channel history and pinned messages); Research (processing shared links through content extraction, automatic categorization, and knowledge graph building). The development flow isolates specific problems, explores message patterns, projects desired outcomes, and determines data requirements and methods. The conclusion is that many specialized tools working together with humans in the loop represents a more viable future than a single superintelligent system.
