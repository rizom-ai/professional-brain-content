# Institutional Failure and Social Contracts

## Summary
Traditional institutions have failed to protect democracy because their legitimacy depends on functioning social contracts rather than constitutional frameworks alone. The COVID pandemic revealed that institutions are only respected when they align with citizens' values, and institutional decay stems from broken social contracts across the political spectrum rather than partisan abuse.

## Content
The article challenges the conventional belief that institutions protect democracy, arguing instead that social contracts—shared aligned values among citizens—form the true foundation of democratic systems. The author, a political philosopher, provides evidence of institutional bankruptcy across the political spectrum, including examples like Israel's disregard for UN resolutions without consequences. The COVID pandemic served as a watershed moment, demonstrating that citizens were willing to suspend constitutional protections for marginal gains, revealing that the constitution functioned as mere 'suspension of disbelief' rather than genuine safeguard. The core insight is that institutions have never truly been constitutional in nature; their effectiveness depends entirely on whether citizens share aligned values and functional social contracts. The implications are profound: institutional reform alone cannot solve current crises—what's needed is rebuilding social contracts through renewed conversations about collective values and shared commitments. The article proposes that modern civil societies should be reconstructed using decentralized tools and asynchronous alternatives available today, but only when grounded in strong common values that require constant debate and negotiation. A functioning social contract must balance individual rights with shared responsibilities to create effective institutions capable of withstanding deeply divided eras.
