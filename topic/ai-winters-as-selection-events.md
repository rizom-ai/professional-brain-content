# AI Winters as Selection Events

## Summary
Analyzes historical AI winters not as failures but as deliberate selection pressures that shaped the field toward control and away from emergence. Each winter systematically eliminated approaches favoring bottom-up learning and human reasoning in favor of rule-based control and statistical scaling.

## Content
The first AI winter (1974-1980) selected against bottom-up learning in favor of rule-based control systems. The second winter (1987-1993) selected against human reasoning approaches in favor of statistical scaling methods. Rather than viewing winters as unfortunate setbacks, this analysis frames them as evolutionary pressures that have consistently prioritized centralized control over distributed emergence. This historical pattern reveals a structural bias in how AI development has been funded, incentivized, and directed. Artists like Casey Reas, Ian Cheng, and Pierre Huyghe understood alternative paths involving autonomous systems and living ecosystems that the field systematically abandoned.
