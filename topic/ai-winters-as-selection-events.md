# AI Winters as Selection Events

## Content
The deck analyzes AI winters not as failures but as selection events that shaped which approaches dominated the field. The first winter (1974-1980) selected against bottom-up learning systems in favor of rule-based control, while the second winter (1987-1993) rejected human reasoning models in favor of statistical scaling. Each winter systematically eliminated approaches that enabled emergence in favor of those enabling centralized control and predictability. This historical pattern reveals a consistent bias in AI development toward controllable, measurable systems rather than those capable of genuine autonomy or distributed intelligence. Understanding this selection pressure is crucial for recognizing what paths were foreclosed and what alternatives remain available.
