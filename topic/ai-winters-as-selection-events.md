# AI Winters as Selection Events

## Summary
A historical analysis of how AI winters functioned as evolutionary pressures that systematically eliminated approaches emphasizing emergence and autonomy in favor of centralized control mechanisms. Each winter represented a critical juncture where certain technical and philosophical approaches were selected against.

## Content
The presentation frames AI winters not as failures but as selection events that shaped the field's trajectory away from emergence-based approaches. The First Winter (1974-1980) marked a transition from bottom-up learning approaches toward rule-based control systems. The Second Winter (1987-1993) selected against human reasoning models in favor of statistical scaling approaches. These weren't accidental developments but systematic preferences for control and predictability over autonomy and emergence. The analysis suggests that Conway's Game of Life—where three simple rules generate universal computation—represents the 'road not taken,' demonstrating how genuine intelligence emerges from minimal rules and distributed interaction rather than top-down design. The winters reveal a fundamental choice: systems designed for control versus systems designed for emergence. Artists and researchers like Casey Reas, Ian Cheng, Pierre Huyghe, Hito Steyerl, and Refik Anadol understood this distinction and explored alternative paths where intelligence emerges through practice, autonomous narratives, living ecosystems, and critical engagement with AI systems. The implication is that future AI development faces the same choice—continue selecting for control, or deliberately choose emergence and distributed agency.
