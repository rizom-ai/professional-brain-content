# Ecosystem Architecture and Future Design

## Summary
The article advocates ecosystem architecture as a practice for designing multiple inhabitable futures based on shared values, rejecting predetermined narratives and enabling communities to shape alternatives that resist surveillance capitalism. This approach emphasizes alignment before connection and the importance of examining who presents futures and their underlying interests.

## Content
Ecosystem architecture encourages investment in futures we would like to inhabit rather than accepting predetermined outcomes. The true promise of a decentralized internet lies in multiplying public and private spaces with genuine ownership. To prevent further fragmentation, alignment must precede connection—understanding what people need and presenting tangible alternatives rather than asking what they want. This prevents the repetition of probable outcomes that fortify the status quo. Critical questions must be asked about any presented future: who is presenting it, how are they situated, and what interests do they have? Past futurists and counter-futures, particularly Afrofuturism, offer temporal complications that challenge linear progress narratives and teach rejection of predetermined futures. Multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values can peacefully coexist, but they require intentional design, development, and nurturing. Ecosystem architecture is the practice that enables communities to take responsibility for creating and maintaining these alternative futures.
