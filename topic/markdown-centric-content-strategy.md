# Markdown-Centric Content Strategy

## Content
Rizom Brains treats plain markdown files with YAML frontmatter as the single source of truth, ensuring portability, version control compatibility, and tool-agnostic editing capabilities. This design philosophy means users can edit content with any text editor while the system automatically processes, indexes, and makes files available across multiple interfaces including CLI, Matrix, MCP, and static websites. The directory-sync plugin enables automatic processing of markdown files when saved, eliminating manual synchronization overhead and reducing friction in the knowledge management workflow. By keeping the database purely as an index rather than the source of truth, the system maintains data independence and prevents vendor lock-in, allowing users to retain full control over their knowledge assets regardless of platform changes.
