# Rizom Infrastructure

## Summary
A proposed ecosystem of tools and protocols designed to enable distributed intelligence and collective knowledge creation through decentralized systems. Rizom reimagines how organizations can function as living systems rather than hierarchical machines.

## Content
Rizom represents a concrete alternative to centralized AI systems, built on four foundational layers: Knowledge Brains (personal, team, and collective knowledge systems using git-based versioning that evolves), Algorithmic Trust (outcome-based certification enabling trust without institutional gatekeepers), Open Protocols (HTTP, MCP, ACP standards preventing platform lock-in), and Ownership Stakes (franchise models with equity alignment so participants own what they build). The system operates on a capture-remix-share-scale cycle where intelligence is understood as practice—something you do with the system rather than something the system does to you. This directly opposes the 'Doom Economy' where companies raise billions to protect against existential risks from systems they're simultaneously building. Rizom's vision is that the future of work is play—decentralized ecosystems where knowledge flows freely while preserving ownership, collective intelligence emerges from individual autonomy, and humans and machines meet in shared practices. The underlying philosophy treats organizations as living systems that evolve and adapt rather than machines that execute predetermined functions.
