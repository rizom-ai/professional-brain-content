# Play-Based Organizational Design

## Content
The article reframes work design around principles of play—voluntary engagement, self-directed rules, freedom to fail, and merged learning-doing cycles. Play represents work designed around human nature rather than against it, enabling people to lose track of time through intrinsic motivation rather than external control. This contrasts sharply with current systems that crush creativity and connection through rigid structures. The author argues that when AI handles busywork, what remains is the deeply human work of creativity and meaning-making, which naturally flourishes in play-like environments where people feel ownership and alignment with their actual values.
