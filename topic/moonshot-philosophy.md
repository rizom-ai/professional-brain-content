# Moonshot Philosophy

## Content
The moonshot approach, popularized by Google's X division, represents a strategy of tackling ambitious, seemingly unsolvable problems with massive resource investment to achieve exponential (10x) impact. This philosophy was inspired by President Kennedy's Apollo program and has become a dominant paradigm in tech and venture capital. X's methodology follows a simple formula: identify an unsolvable problem, invest heavily in resources, and commercialize the solution. However, the article critically examines how this approach has been widely copied by agencies, incubators, and VCs who often lack the resources or genuine commitment of the original, leading to numerous failed or underwhelming initiatives. The moonshot mentality has created a culture where entrepreneurs prioritize grandiose claims about solving humanity's biggest problems over delivering practical, incremental improvements.
