# Online Education Design

## Summary
The post explores how online learning can enhance rather than compromise educational quality, drawing lessons from innovative programming platforms like Code School. It argues that online education should leverage its unique affordances—short-form content, automated feedback, and engaging design—rather than simply replicate traditional classroom experiences.

## Content
In 2013, the author and Marijn Koolen proposed that the University of Amsterdam invest in online education, not as a cost-saving measure or response to threats, but as an opportunity to increase educational quality. They were inspired by innovative online learning platforms in the programming education space, particularly Code School, which combined short videos (5-10 minutes) with in-browser coding assignments and automatic feedback through unit tests. The key principles they identified were: Online is not a Compromise—recognizing that online offers unique educational possibilities impossible offline, with lessons designed specifically for the digital format rather than recreating classroom vibes; Automation is your Friend—using technology like in-browser editors and real-time feedback mechanisms to provide immediate assessment without human intervention; and Learning should be Fun—incorporating gamification, creative themes, and engaging design elements (such as memorable theme songs) that make learning enjoyable and aid retention. The author reflects that by 2020, most institutions still treat online learning as a second-best substitute for in-person education rather than a distinct pedagogical approach. The critical failure in their 2013 proposal was not in the diagnosis but in the communication—they shared conclusions without conveying their journey, passion, and enthusiasm for what online education could become. The author regrets not better articulating the vision that could have prevented educators from defaulting to uninspired Zoom lectures during the pandemic.
