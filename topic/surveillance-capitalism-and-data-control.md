# Surveillance Capitalism and Data Control

## Summary
The article examines how surveillance capitalism weaponizes behavioral data to predict and control human behavior, with corporations and governments collaborating to exploit personal information. It explores the dangers of this system and the urgency of intervention before predetermined dystopian futures become inevitable.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as defined by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments share a vested interest in connecting more people to the internet to gather larger amounts of granular data, using this information to predict and preempt people's actions. The current internet fragmentation has enabled this exploitation, as people have outsourced responsibility for the internet to centralized authorities. Data serves as the weapon of choice in this system, allowing behavioral pattern analysis to control outcomes. The danger lies in naively expanding internet access without addressing underlying power dynamics, which only feeds the cycle of exploitation. Without swift interventions, humanity faces a future already being written by those with control over data systems.
