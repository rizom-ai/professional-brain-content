# Moonshot Factory Philosophy

## Content
The article examines Google X's moonshot factory model, which aims to solve unsolvable problems through massive resource investment with the goal of achieving 10x impact. The original formula consists of three steps: focus on an unsolvable problem, spend significant money on it, and sell the resulting solution. However, the piece critiques how this approach, while producing inspiring marketing narratives, has failed to actually solve the world's biggest problems over a decade. The moonshot philosophy has inspired numerous copycat organizations in the tech industry, though many have diluted or distorted the original vision, focusing on fashionable problems rather than genuinely unsolvable ones.
