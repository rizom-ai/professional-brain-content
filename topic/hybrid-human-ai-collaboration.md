# Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration

## Summary
Explores the philosophical and practical dimensions of integrating artificial agents (bots) with human team members in collaborative systems. The discussion challenges conventional assumptions about humanness in team dynamics, proposing that agency and effective contribution matter more than human identity in achieving collective goals.

## Content
The piece presents a vision for online collaboration developed for the Planet B project, a thought experiment proposing a mission to colonize a habitable planet. The core challenge involves building effective teams among dispersed members who may never meet physically. The proposed solution involves complementing human team members with autonomous bots that function as collaborative agents. The central thesis shifts focus from humanness to agency—what matters is whether an agent effectively contributes to mission goals, regardless of whether they're human or artificial. This raises fundamental questions: Does it matter if a coworker is human if their contributions are valuable? Does humanness become irrelevant if it endangers the mission? The discussion acknowledges practical challenges including bot autonomy, governance structures for hybrid teams, and risks associated with bot-to-bot communication. The piece uses Planet B as a counterfactual space to safely explore these questions before real-world implementation, suggesting that answers developed in this imaginary space may inform future collaborative system design. The exploration confronts fundamental assumptions about collaboration, intelligence, and what defines productive team membership.
