# Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration

## Summary
Explores the design and governance of collaborative systems that integrate both human and artificial agents working toward shared goals. The analysis challenges traditional assumptions about the necessity of humanness in teamwork, proposing that agency and contribution matter more than the nature of the agent.

## Content
The piece examines a thought experiment called Planet B—a scenario involving a dispersed global team tasked with colonizing a habitable planet. Rather than relying solely on human team members, the proposed solution involves integrating a 'mob of bots with an attitude' into the collaborative structure. The core argument shifts focus from humanness to agency: what matters is whether an agent effectively contributes to shared goals, regardless of whether they're human or artificial. This raises fundamental questions about collaboration: Does it matter if a coworker is human if their contributions are valuable? Does humanness become irrelevant if it endangers the mission? The piece acknowledges practical challenges including bot autonomy, bot-to-bot communication risks, and the governance structures needed for hybrid teams. Rather than providing definitive answers, Planet B serves as a counterfactual space to safely explore these questions before real-world implementation. The underlying premise is that thinking through these challenges forces us to confront fundamental assumptions about collaboration, intelligence, and what defines a productive team member—insights that may inform the design of collaborative systems in the future.
