# Abundance Economics

## Summary
This topic examines the shift from scarcity-driven capitalism to an economy of excess, drawing on Bataille's philosophical framework and contemporary practices like Borawake's Garb-Age. It challenges traditional economic models by reframing waste and abundance as central organizing principles rather than externalities, with implications for how we understand value, resources, and human society.

## Content
The article explores how traditional capitalism is fundamentally organized around scarcity as its core principle, examining how this mindset has persisted despite technological innovations that should have challenged it. It traces the historical evolution of excess thinking through Walter Benjamin's analysis of mechanical reproduction and its ideological implications, showing how technical affordances shape economic systems. Georges Bataille's concept of an economy of excess is presented as a counterpoint to capitalist scarcity-mindedness, arguing that true abundance exists in natural energy flows (solar energy, biochemical surpluses) that capitalism fails to recognize. The distinction between venture capitalism's wasteful approach (disposing of failed experiments) and Bataille's embrace of The Accursed Share is highlighted as a crucial philosophical difference. The article then examines Shraddha Borawake's Garb-Age practice as a contemporary manifestation of this philosophy, showing how waste is reframed as intrinsic to both nature and culture rather than external to them. This perspective dissolves traditional dichotomies between nature/culture, purity/waste, and utility/excess, revealing that fragmentation and dispersal are fundamental characteristics of how the world actually functions. The implications extend to environmental management, resource stewardship, and digital ecosystems, suggesting that recognizing inherent abundance rather than manufactured scarcity opens new possibilities for addressing global challenges. The article argues that this paradigm shift moves beyond simple waste management to a fundamental reconsideration of what humans value and why, emphasizing non-utilitarian, symbolic, and psychological dimensions of experience that material abundance alone cannot satisfy.
