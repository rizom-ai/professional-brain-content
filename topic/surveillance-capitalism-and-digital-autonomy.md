# Surveillance Capitalism and Digital Autonomy

## Summary
The article critiques surveillance capitalism as a system that weaponizes behavioral data to control people, examining how corporations and governments have consolidated power over digital spaces. It argues for reclaiming decentralized internet infrastructure and designing alternative futures that prioritize user autonomy and alignment of values before expanding connectivity.

## Content
Surveillance capitalism, as defined by Shoshana Zuboff, unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Corporations and governments share a vested interest in connecting more people to gather larger amounts of granular behavioral data, enabling them to predict and preempt human actions. The article argues that naively expanding internet access without addressing underlying power structures only perpetuates this cycle of exploitation. The original promise of the decentralized internet was to multiply public and private spaces with user ownership, but this vision was abandoned when responsibility was outsourced to governments and corporations. To prevent predetermined dystopian futures, the author advocates for alignment—understanding what people need and presenting them with tangible alternatives—before connecting the unconnected. This requires designing multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values rather than accepting inevitable futures presented by those with vested interests. The practice of ecosystem architecture is positioned as the methodology for creating and nurturing these alternative futures that resist surveillance capitalism's logic.
