# AI Winters as Design Selection

## Summary
Historical analysis of AI winters as deliberate selection events that shaped the field away from emergent, bottom-up approaches toward centralized control systems. Each winter eliminated approaches that threatened centralized authority in favor of manageable, rule-based alternatives.

## Content
The first AI winter (1974-1980) selected against bottom-up learning approaches in favor of rule-based control systems. The second winter (1987-1993) eliminated human reasoning models, selecting instead for statistical scaling approaches. This pattern reveals that AI winters were not random failures but systematic selection events that consistently chose control over emergence. The implications are significant: the current trajectory of AI development is not inevitable but the result of historical choices that prioritized centralized, manageable systems over distributed, autonomous ones. This historical analysis suggests alternative paths were available—exemplified by Conway's Game of Life, which demonstrates how three simple rules can generate universal computation and true emergence. Understanding AI winters as design selections rather than technological failures opens the possibility of deliberately choosing different futures.
