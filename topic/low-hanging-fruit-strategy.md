# Low-Hanging Fruit Strategy

## Content
The content advocates for a deliberate strategy of tackling the 90% of achievable problems first—the low-hanging fruit—rather than pursuing speculative moonshots that rarely succeed. This approach is built on three pillars: radical automation of laborious and boring tasks, human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms that keep AI systems grounded in real user needs, and a focus on solvable problems that deliver immediate value. The strategy recognizes that missed automation opportunities inevitably result in talent waste, as humans spend time on tasks that could be delegated to specialized AI systems. By focusing on practical, incremental improvements across multiple domains, organizations can realize tangible benefits while building toward more sophisticated capabilities.
