# Low-Hanging Fruit Strategy

## Content
The presentation argues for deliberately tackling the practical 90% of problems rather than pursuing ambitious moonshots that rarely succeed. This strategy combines three principles: radical automation of laborious tasks to prevent talent waste, human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms on collaborative platforms, and prioritization of solvable real-world problems over hypothetical breakthroughs. Concrete examples include synchronizing information after absence from messaging apps, extracting tacit knowledge for onboarding, and processing shared links to reduce knowledge gaps. This pragmatic approach contrasts with traditional AI initiatives and demonstrates how focusing on achievable outcomes creates immediate organizational value.
