In contrast to moonshot ambitions, the essay advocates for a pragmatic approach that focuses on solving small, everyday problems that create immediate value. This strategy emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and practical utility over grand visions—addressing real pain points like staff onboarding, knowledge management, and information retrieval. The author positions this as a deliberate philosophical choice rather than a limitation, arguing that incremental solutions to daily challenges can be more impactful than pursuing impossible problems with limited resources. This approach aligns with Shenzhen's iterative design culture, where solutions are refined through practical implementation rather than theoretical perfection.
