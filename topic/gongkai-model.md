# Gongkai Model

## Content
Gongkai represents an open-source approach to hardware innovation originating from Shenzhen's shanzhai ecosystem, fundamentally different from Western open-source practices. Rather than the Western 'broadcast' view of intellectual property where innovation is credited to individual authors, gongkai embodies a 'network' view where knowledge is freely shared as favors and designs are openly distributed. Manufacturers share intricate blueprints, bills of materials, and component sources, creating a dynamic collaborative environment that enables rapid iteration without the constraints of reverse engineering or expensive outdated components. This practice challenges conventional IP frameworks and proves more suited for open hardware development than traditional Western models. Gongkai's flexibility allows the shanzhai ecosystem to innovate at unprecedented speed while democratizing access to hardware design knowledge across distributed networks of makers and manufacturers.
