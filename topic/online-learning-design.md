# Online Learning Design

## Content
Online learning represents a distinct educational mode with its own design principles, not merely a substitute for classroom instruction. Drawing from platforms like Code School, effective online education requires rethinking pedagogy around the digital medium: shorter, focused lessons (5-10 minutes), immediate automated feedback, and interactive in-browser assignments that eliminate the need for human intervention at every step. The key insight is that online learning can offer educational experiences that are fundamentally impossible to replicate offline, such as real-time code validation, instant hints, and seamless integration of content delivery with hands-on practice. Rather than attempting to recreate classroom dynamics through screens, successful online learning embraces what makes the digital medium unique—automation, modularity, and interactivity. This approach transforms online education from a compromise solution into a genuinely superior pedagogical model when designed with intentionality.
