# Online Learning Design

## Content
Online education represents a fundamentally different mode of learning, not merely a compromise or substitute for in-person instruction. Rather than attempting to recreate classroom dynamics remotely, effective online learning leverages the unique affordances of digital platforms to create experiences impossible in traditional settings. The author identifies three key principles from successful platforms like Code School: treating online as its own distinct medium with optimized formats (5-10 minute lessons), using automation and real-time feedback through interactive tools, and designing for engagement through thematic, gamified experiences. The core insight is that online learning should be designed from first principles as a superior alternative, not as a degraded version of classroom teaching.
