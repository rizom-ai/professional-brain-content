# Online Learning Design

## Content
The post explores the untapped potential of online education as a distinct pedagogical approach rather than a substitute for traditional classroom learning. Drawing from Code School's successful model, effective online learning combines short, focused video content (5-10 minutes) with interactive, in-browser assignments that provide real-time automated feedback. The key insight is that online education should leverage its unique affordances—such as immediate feedback loops, creative theming, gamification, and automation—rather than attempting to recreate a traditional classroom experience digitally. When designed thoughtfully, online learning can actually enhance educational quality by making content more engaging, accessible, and allowing for personalized pacing that accommodates diverse learning styles.
