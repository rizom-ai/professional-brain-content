# Online Learning Design

## Content
Online learning represents a distinct educational modality that should be optimized for its own strengths rather than treated as a substitute for traditional classrooms. Drawing from platforms like Code School, effective online education combines short, focused video lessons (5-10 minutes) with integrated, automatically-graded coding assignments that provide real-time feedback. The key insight is that online learning enables pedagogical approaches impossible in physical classrooms—such as immediate automated feedback, interactive in-browser environments, and thematic narrative structures that enhance engagement. Rather than recreating classroom dynamics online, educators should embrace the unique affordances of digital delivery to increase educational quality and create more effective learning experiences.
