# Online Learning Design

## Summary
Explores how online education can be fundamentally better than traditional classroom instruction, not merely a substitute. The piece argues for rethinking online learning as its own medium with unique advantages, using Code School as a model for what effective digital education looks like.

## Content
Online learning has untapped potential that remains underutilized in higher education. Rather than treating online as a second-best alternative to in-person teaching, educators should recognize it as a distinct mode of education with unique capabilities. Code School exemplified this approach through three key principles: First, online is not a compromise—the platform didn't try to recreate classroom vibes but instead optimized for the digital medium with short 5-10 minute lessons and assignments that didn't feel like homework. Second, automation is a friend—in-browser editors with real-time feedback through unit tests and hints eliminated the need for human intervention while maintaining educational rigor. Third, learning should be fun—creative theming, gamification, and memorable elements like course theme songs made learning engaging while embedding educational content. The author argues that in 2013, he and Marijn Koolen proposed that the University of Amsterdam invest in online education not primarily to save money or scale classes, but to increase the quality of higher education and research. Seven years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most online teaching still mimics traditional lectures through Zoom rather than leveraging the medium's strengths. The failure to convince stakeholders in 2013 stemmed not from weak ideas but from poor communication—sharing conclusions without conveying the journey or enthusiasm behind them.
