# Moonshot vs. Pragmatic Innovation

## Summary
The essay contrasts the high-risk, resource-intensive moonshot approach popularized by Google X with a pragmatic alternative focused on solving everyday problems with minimal resources. It critiques how the moonshot formula has been copied and commodified by countless organizations while arguing for a philosophy of tackling low-hanging fruit instead.

The moonshot concept originated with President Kennedy's Apollo program and was formalized by Google X as a systematic approach to solving 'unsolvable problems' through massive resource investment. Google X's three-step formula: focus on an unsolvable problem, spend significant money, and sell the solution. However, over a decade later, the actual impact of moonshots on world problems remains minimal, while the marketing appeal has inspired countless imitators. These 'counterfeit moon shooters' have simplified the formula to: focus on a fashionable problem and ask for outrageous amounts of money. The essay criticizes this trend, noting that entrepreneurs now seek funding to solve humanity's biggest problems rather than solve specific customer needs, often making grandiose claims without delivering results. In contrast, Rizom adopts the 'low end theory'—deliberately avoiding moonshot ambitions and instead focusing on solving small, practical everyday problems that most overlook: onboarding new staff, organizing shared links, summarizing missed messages. This approach prioritizes simplicity, achievability, and actual user satisfaction over ego and glory. The philosophy emphasizes that low-hanging fruit, though humble, often provides the sweetest outcomes and addresses genuine needs that create tangible value.
