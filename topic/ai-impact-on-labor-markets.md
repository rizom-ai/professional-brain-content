# AI Impact on Labor Markets

## Summary
Rather than viewing AI as a job destroyer, the article reframes it as exposing how much human talent has been wasted on busywork. AI handling routine tasks reveals what remains as distinctly human: creativity, connection, and meaning-making—the very capacities current systems fail to cultivate.

## Content
AI is not taking jobs; it is exposing the massive opportunity cost of how we currently organize work. When machines can handle busywork, what remains is the deeply human work: creativity, connection, meaning-making—precisely what industrial work systems crush. The real stakes are not just economic but existential. The opportunity cost includes the version of yourself that dies a little each day choosing safety over growth, and the message sent to children that passion is only for weekends, not Wednesdays, that dreams are advice we give but not lives we live. AI's emergence creates a critical juncture: either we continue wasting human potential on routine tasks that machines can perform, or we finally restructure work around what makes humans irreplaceable. The technology itself is neutral; the choice is how we deploy it—to further optimize control systems or to liberate human creative capacity for meaningful contribution.
