# Public Badges Framework

## Content
Public Badges represents a practical tool designed to address the trust crisis by enabling organizations to collect and communicate evidence about their values and trustworthiness to users. Rather than relying on subjective anecdotes or corporate slogans like 'Don't be evil,' this framework creates mechanisms for evidence-based verification of institutional commitments. The initiative, developed by Public Spaces, Waag, and Offcourse Studio, aims to provide building blocks that help organizations demonstrate their reliability through verifiable credentials and value alignment. This approach bridges the gap between purely technological solutions and entirely anecdotal trust, creating a middle ground where institutional accountability can be made transparent and measurable.
