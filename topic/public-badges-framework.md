# Public Badges Framework

## Content
Public Badges represents a practical solution for making trust measurable and communicable in digital spaces. Rather than relying on security protocols or personal anecdotes, the framework enables organizations to collect and share evidence about their values and trustworthiness. The initiative, developed by Public Spaces, Waag, and Offcourse Studio, positions itself as infrastructure for evidence-based trust relations. This approach bridges technology and human organizational networks, creating mechanisms where trust can be verified and communicated transparently.
