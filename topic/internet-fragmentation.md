# Internet Fragmentation

## Summary
The article examines how the global internet has fragmented into distinct regional ecosystems and explores the historical, technical, and geopolitical factors driving this fragmentation. Rather than viewing fragmentation as a problem to solve, it proposes embracing it as an opportunity for innovation, localized development, and improved resilience through ecosystem architecture principles.

## Content
The internet has evolved from a unified global network into fragmented regional ecosystems shaped by technological advancements and geopolitical realities. The article traces this history from ARPANET origins through the browser wars of the 1990s to modern fragmentation accelerated by Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations. Three types of fragmentation are identified: Technical Fragmentation (infrastructure interoperability issues), Governmental Fragmentation (policy-based constraints on information access), and Commercial Fragmentation (business practices limiting internet use). Examples include China and Russia's distinct internets, Asian superapps replacing traditional browsers, African mesh and peer-to-peer networks, and mobile app store ecosystems. The article critiques dominant narratives focused on restoring the 'OG Internet,' categorizing proponents into Past Dwellers (nostalgic for early internet ideals), Power Mongers (geopolitical stakeholders), and Gold Diggers (companies profiting from data collection). It argues that the OG Internet's promise of universal consensus through open access failed—instead producing propaganda, misinformation, and identity politics. Rather than viewing fragmentation negatively, the article advocates for ecosystem architecture as a framework that embraces fragmentation to enable localized innovation, improved access in underserved areas, enhanced privacy and data sovereignty, cultural preservation, and resilience against cyber threats. The future internet should be designed as a living ecosystem that respects diversity while fostering connections for mutual growth.
