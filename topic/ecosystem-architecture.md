# Ecosystem Architecture

## Summary
Ecosystem architecture is presented as a practice for designing multiple inhabitable futures based on shared values rather than accepting predetermined dystopias. It emphasizes alignment before connection, creating diverse spaces that coexist peacefully while maintaining ownership and responsibility.

## Content
Ecosystem architecture encourages investment in futures we would like to inhabit rather than settling for expected outcomes. The practice involves aligning misaligned parties before connecting the unconnected, starting by understanding what people need rather than what they want. This process shapes tangible futures from identified needs and gives people options to choose between alternatives. Without a proper palette of alternatives, people repeat the most probable outcome, which typically reinforces the status quo. Ecosystem architecture requires designing, developing, and nurturing multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values. The decentralized internet's original promise was multiplication of public and private spaces with ownership over them, but this was lost through outsourcing responsibility to governments and corporations. The practice seeks to reclaim this by preventing further fragmentation and creating alternatives to surveillance capitalism.
