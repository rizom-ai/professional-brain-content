# Ecosystem Architecture

## Content
Ecosystem architecture is presented as a practice for designing multiple inhabitable futures that resist predetermined dystopias and surveillance capitalism. Rather than accepting a single inevitable future, this approach emphasizes creating diverse, value-aligned spaces that can peacefully coexist. The practice begins with alignment—understanding what people need and shaping tangible alternatives before connecting them—rather than naively expanding connectivity. Ecosystem architecture draws on diverse intellectual traditions including Afrofuturism and decentralized internet principles, positioning it as a methodology for reclaiming human agency and responsibility in shaping our technological and organizational futures.
