# Ecosystem Architecture

## Content
Ecosystem architecture is a design practice for creating multiple inhabitable futures based on shared values rather than accepting predetermined dystopian outcomes. It emphasizes designing tangible alternatives before connecting communities, ensuring alignment of needs and values precedes connectivity. This approach enables peaceful coexistence of diverse spaces with different organizational principles, moving away from one-size-fits-all models. The practice involves imagining, shaping, and actively performing better alternatives to the futures being written for us by powerful institutions. Ecosystem architecture represents a proactive methodology for reclaiming agency over our technological and social futures through intentional design and community participation.
