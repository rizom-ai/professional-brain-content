# Ecosystem Architecture

## Summary
A design philosophy that treats organizations as living systems rather than machines, incorporating diverse cultural and technological lineages like Afrofuturism, DAOs, and mesh networks. This approach recognizes that traditional organizational models are insufficient for contemporary tools and contexts.

## Content
Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing and cultivating organizations as if they were living systems rather than machines. It borrows promiscuously from multiple sources—Afrofuturism, Shanzhai culture, DAOs, mesh networks—recognizing that the future won't come from a single lineage. The underlying conviction is that we need structures that work more like living systems, not because hierarchy is inherently bad, but because our tools and contexts have outgrown what traditional organizational models can handle. The goal isn't to restore an imagined golden age, but to build something genuinely inhabitable. This philosophy emerged from years of working with education technology and community building, learning what makes communities thrive or collapse. Rizom, the current project, applies these principles as an ecosystem of tools helping individuals and organizations create, connect, and share knowledge.
