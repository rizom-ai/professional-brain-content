# Ecosystem Architecture

## Summary
Ecosystem architecture is a practice of designing and cultivating organizations as living systems rather than machines, borrowing from diverse traditions like Afrofuturism, DAOs, and mesh networks. This approach recognizes that contemporary tools and contexts have outgrown traditional hierarchical organizational models.

## Content
Ecosystem architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we design organizations. Rather than treating organizations as machines with rigid hierarchies, this practice cultivates them as living systems capable of adaptation and regeneration. The approach draws promiscuously from multiple lineages: Afrofuturism, Shanzhai culture, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and mesh networks. The underlying conviction is that we need structures that work more like living systems than machines—not because hierarchy is inherently bad, but because our tools and contexts have outgrown what traditional organizational models can handle. This philosophy emerged from philosophical training (Heidegger, Bataille, Benjamin, Kittler) and practical experience building communities through projects like Offcourse and Rizom. The goal is not to restore some imagined golden age, but to build something genuinely inhabitable in the present moment.
