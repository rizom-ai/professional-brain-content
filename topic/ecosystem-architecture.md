# Ecosystem Architecture

## Content
Ecosystem architecture is a design practice for creating multiple inhabitable futures based on shared values, rather than accepting predetermined dystopias. It involves aligning communities around what they need before connecting them, then offering genuine alternatives rather than a one-size-fits-all model. The practice draws on diverse traditions including Afrofuturism and decentralized systems thinking, emphasizing that multiple ecosystems can peacefully coexist. Ecosystem architecture requires active design, development, and nurturing—these spaces don't emerge spontaneously but must be intentionally cultivated to prevent the consolidation of power.
