# Ecosystem Architecture

## Content
Ecosystem architecture is a forward-thinking practice that blends decentralized systems with regenerative design principles to address complex challenges. Rather than viewing organizations as machines, it treats them as living systems that can adapt, renew, and thrive through interconnectedness. This approach emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and resilience, ensuring solutions are sustainable and equitable. It draws from diverse sources including Afrofuturism, mesh networks, and decentralized autonomous organizations to create structures that work with natural rhythms rather than against them. The core conviction is that we need tools and contexts that move beyond traditional hierarchical models to handle the complexity of modern challenges.
